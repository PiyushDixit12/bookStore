        "synopsis": "Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets? A novel about all the choices that go into a life well lived.Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.Matt Haig is the author of novels such as The Midnight Library, How to Stop Time, The Humans, The Radleys, and the forthcoming The Life Impossible. He has also written books for children, such as A Boy Called Christmas, and the memoir Reasons to Stay Alive.I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.\n   “She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”\nAnd these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:\n   “As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”\nSome of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:\n   “And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”\nAnd I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————\n  \nThe premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide. \n   “Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”\nThis may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster — it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not. “Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”, says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.\n   “When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”\nIn that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gem My Real Children had a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.\n  “Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”\nAnd then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora) we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.\n   “She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”\nAnd if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, except it’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.\n  \n\n   “She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”\nAnd all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite. \n  “I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.” \n2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.————\n“You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.’Nora shook her head. This was a bit too much for a Philosophy graduate to take.”It’s a bit too much for this science graduate over here, too.——————Also posted on my blog.“The only way to learn is to live”Fuck, this book hit me so hard. I finished this book a few days ago and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. It has one of my favorite themes or tropes in a book, where we follow a main character who at the beginning of the story is very depressed and possible suicidal and doesn't see the point of life, but then slowly throughout the story begins to build an admiration toward humanity and life. This book was so beautifully written and I love the way this book asks the question: what is the best way to live?“Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices… Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”It's a really cool concept, that between life and death you enter the midnight library, where you get the opportunity to see how your life would've been different had you made different decisions. I think a lot about this, what my life would be like had I made different choices and wondering if I'm the happiest version of myself? This book forces you to ask hard questions, like what makes a life worth living? And are your dreams for yourself really something you want? I love the way this book talks about regrets and how most of the time our regrets are a load of bullshit of things that are out of our control and they are causing a major burden on our life. “A person was like a city. You couldn't let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don't like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worth-while.”Matt Haig is such a talented writer and there are so many passages and quotes I'm obsessed with in this book. Much like The Humans (one of my all time favorites) this book has you questioning what the point of life is and thinking how truly absurd life can be. But I feel like this book is much more serious than The Humans, there are trigger warnings for depression and suicidal thoughts in this book, and it was very very heavy on my heart to read this book, where as The Humans feels a lot more light-hearted and hilarious. \n  “It is easy to mourn the lives we aren't living. Easy to wish we'd developed other other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we'd worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga. It takes no effort to miss the friends we didn't make and the work we didn't do the people we didn't do and the people we didn't marry and the children we didn't have. It is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people, and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be. It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out. But it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It's the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people's worst enemy. We can't tell if any of those other versions would of been better or worse. Those lives are happening, it is true, but you are happening as well, and that is the happening we have to focus on.”\nBut god damn, I loved this book. I cried a lot at the end. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time. I also filmed a reading vlog and I included this book, you can see that here: https://youtu.be/9NiJtrbogyoEverybody probably knows the premise of this book by now (I mean this book is everywhere): a library with an infinite number of books. The books of regret. You open one and it transfers you to the life where you didn’t make that particular regret. Was it marrying someone or traveling or maybe other little things.While I admit I don’t actively pursue parallel universes kind of books on one hand, and on the other, the main reason why I read this book is that I was choosing the best fiction this year (to vote in the GR awards), I was actually looking forward to it. Most of my friends on GR gave it 5 glowing stars. A book beloved by the majority... I had a high chance of enjoying it. Sadly, I didn’t.First, it was boring. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator wasn’t the best, honestly. Not that her voice was annoying but it was kind of monotone. It certainly didn’t help either that I was listening to Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine at the same time, in which the narrator was so animated reading the book.I also found all of Nora’s revelations and enlightenment typical. Like sure I already know that. The ending was also painfully predictable from the start. So when you can guess where the book is going, everything in between becomes not so interesting anymore, especially if you don’t care about the main character. Unfortunately, I found Nora dull. She wasn’t interesting as the main character and I couldn’t relate nor care about her and empathise with her story. I can’t believe she was this multitalented in fields that aren’t related whatsoever to each other. She could’ve been an athlete, a scholar or a musician. All successful. All are based on life decisions. I also think that she had the privilege of choosing such different options. Many don’t. I don’t mean by that the book of regrets but rather focusing on a particular career path from the start. For example, many parents don’t nurture their children’s interests like music or gymnastics for several reasons maybe they can’t afford it or they just don’t care. But Nora had so many options. Luckily, the book was short. I also didn’t hate anything about it, hence the 2-star rating. But at the same time, I can’t name anything I liked. Maybe one of the lives, in particular, was more intriguing than the rest because of the two characters we met and.. the concept. It didn’t help that the book got repetitive sometimes. The premise was much more promising than the book itself. The “message” was also pretty plain obvious. Yet many liked The Midnight Library, however. So it might be more of a “me and not you” kind of book. But let me tell you this: if you don’t find the parallel universes interesting to read about in stories, don’t read this novel. Don’t be fooled with “LIBRARY. MIDNIGHT LIBRARY. BOOOOOKS.” The library is just more of a metaphor. Most of the events in this book take place in the real world. And unless you’re interested in kind of self-help books (or motivational ones), don’t read this novel either. Because it’s more about what Nora discovered about herself and life, of course, by dealing with/trying to escape from her regrets.But then again, the majority liked this book so you might too and it's simply not my cup of tea. Yet, it was a dreadfully boring.Okay! No more words! This is one of the best sci-fi dances with fantasy which carries additional philosophic vibes novel of the year! I LOVED IT! ( this is not kind of toasting for the book and raising your glass kind of loving it. This is more like climbing at the top of the roof and declaring your love by shouting and howling to the moon kind of love. If you read the song lyrics of “ Howl” at the book you may probably understand why I feel so enthusiastic and why I’m writing a high volume review!) This book is not only about Nora Seed who is trapped in her life, seeing herself a failure, a disposable human waste who has nothing to achieve, will never be missed by anyone . It’s about regrets, unfinished plans, what ifs, approval of families, drugs, mistakes, giving up, realizing other people’s dreams, self regret, insecurities, self harm, love, passion and hate...When Nora tries to end her life, she opens her eyes in a library filled with books which contain different versions of her life story. If she finds the right book and most proper life she can live fulfilled and happy, that will mean she can be saved! Thankfully the librarian Mrs. Elm here for here just like she has done when she was a little girl who recently learned she lost her dad. Nora could be a swimmer, a rock star, a philosopher, a wife, a traveler, a glaciologist, a mother, winery or local pub owner. She can say “yes” to her ex and accept his offer to live in a small town and own a local pub. Or she can say “yes” to coffee offer of a nice doctor candidate Ash to pursue happiness and love. She can win Olympic medals or she can taste the tempting charm of fame with her songs she writes and performs all around the world. She can be everything or anything. But after living so much lives, nearly thousand different versions, will she find which is best for her and which life form will suit to catch the real happiness? Can she live without family members or can she handle losing her friends to death? What does she really want? What does she expect ? And most importantly will she learn to face the things she regrets the most? Because however she’s ready to start her fresh life with open hands, those clutches of regret always pull her back and prevent her to see what she’s really looking for! Beautiful, meaningful, dazzling, emotional, heart wrenching, poetic, realistic : these are the words which come to my mind after reading this book. Just like the definition of ideal life. Sigh...bloginstagramfacebooktwitterIt is no secret that Matt Haig has mental health issues, dogged by the darkness of depression that has taken its toll on his life. His acute observations and experience of his condition informs this exquisite, inspiring, compassionate and empathetic novel where he creates the concept of the midnight library, to be found in the spaces between life and death, to explore life, the issues that afflict our world, through philosophy and more, endeavouring to tease out what might make life worth living and a joy and what gives it meaning. The device used to implement his goal is the ordinary Nora Seed, who has lived her life trying to please others, who has hit rock bottom, suffering the loss of her cat, her job, overwhelmed by the burden of a lifetime of regrets, seeing no light in her life whatsoever. She is tempted by thoughts of suicide that has her ending up at the midnight library.The midnight library is magical, for a start, the library has a limitless number of books, and these books are far from ordinary, Haig sprinkles gold dust in each book, offering Nora the opportunity to see how her life would have turned out if each and every decision at every point in her life had been different. The books illustrate the endless possibilities that life holds for Nora and all of us. Nora explores each book, with inquisitiveness and curiosity, the widely disparate lives that could have been hers, no easy task as she has to slip into each new life with the complications of being unfamiliar with it and do so without alerting the other people present. It soon becomes clear that there are pros and cons to each book/life, to each decision and choice made, each life containing its own mix of despair, pain and regrets that must be accommodated and handled.Haig offers a touching narrative that speaks of the joys to be found in living, attained through Nora's eyes as she tries to untangle what really matters in life, putting life in context and perspective with all its ongoing changes, complexities, and an understanding no life is perfect in itself. In some ways, this is a version of It's A Wonderful Life, a favourite film for so many people. What I was so struck by is just how many readers might find this helpful for our lock down times, so many have suffered unbearable losses and illness, have had to face not seeing all those we love and mean so much to us, whilst being weighed down with worries and concerns about how to cope with fears regarding jobs, childcare, money and more. A beautifully nuanced novel that I am sure many will love as much as me. Highly recommended. Many thanks to Canongate for an ARC.Okay. Picture this: you are about to bite into a cookie. A big, warm cookie. Kinda crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, yummy and chocolate chip-y and presumably made with brown butter and flaky sea salt, as all the best cookies are.And then you take a big ol' chomp, and...oh no. Not a chocolate chip at all.This cookie is filled with...RAISINS.Have you immersed yourself in that experience? Really felt the high expectations and the all-consuming disappointment?Good.Because that was my experience with this book.This is not a bad book, necessarily, just like raisin-y cookies are not a bad food. (They are closer to granola bars than cookies, but my favorite in the Chewy Granola Bar Variety Pack was always oatmeal raisin, like a six-year-old grumpy old man, so that's not a negative in my personal lexicon.)It's just that it could be much better. And I thought it would be.I thought this was going to be a magical realism-y (my favorite), book-filled (my favorite), beautifully written (everyone's favorite) romp through a brilliant new world.Instead, it was a very fluffy, very...done-before-feeling It's A Wonderful Life-esque feel-good discussion of suicide.(I mention this further down, but this is SO, SO triggering for suicide.)That's not a bad thing. It's just not what I wanted. Or needed. Or anything the genre really aches for at all.But whatever.Bottom line: I should bake cookies and reread The Starless Sea. Both instead of having read this and as a daily routine.------------pre-reviewfor a book with library in the title, and a library as the setting, and \"library\" four times in the synopsis, this had remarkably little to do with libraries.(also, this is massively, unrelentingly triggering for suicide. fair warning because i wish i'd been more prepared!)review to come / 3 stars------------currently-reading updatesstarted this and immediately realized i'm mentally comparing it to the Starless Sea already.both book + i are destined to fail.------------tbr reviewSomewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality.um.(deep breath)YESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYES\n  \"That is just me. I add nothing. I am wallowing in self-pity.\"\nNo truer words have been said by Nora, the world's largest wet blanket. Woe is her, folks.Nora ends up at The Midnight Library, a place between life and death, because she doesn't want to live anymore. The library is full of books, each representing a life she could've had, had she made different choices. Now she has a chance to undo all her numerous regrets and to try out all the lives she's missed out on, to see if there is another one she would like better.Lest you think I'm cold-hearted for not loving this, I assure you, I'm not. Normally, I love sappy, cheesy, inspirational mush. I watch Hallmark movies. I believe in soulmates and happily ever after. I cry during every sweet scene in every movie. And yet this book left me so cold inside, and I'll try to put into words why.For one thing, this story doesn't come across as fiction so much as self-help disguised as fiction. The lessons to be learned in here are pretty obvious right from the beginning, yet they are presented like some sort of epiphany that can only be understood if explained slowly and repeatedly. We are forced to endure these lessons over and over every time Nora goes back to the library. Either Nora is the most dim-witted of characters, or the author thinks us readers are.Another problem is that it's really hard to connect with Nora. She'll take a situation, suck every ounce of joy out of it, and interpret what's left in the most negative way possible. She's full of regret for every decision she's ever made, and thinks the grass is always greener. However, other than being negative, she literally has no other personality traits. She's a blank slate, dull and uninteresting. I also have issues with the core messages in this book. Nora finally learns her lesson, but only after having fixated on each regret, remade every decision, and lived all subsequent lives. I'm also uncomfortable with the implication that if you're depressed, you only need to change your outlook and you will feel better. That goes against everything we understand about mental illness, including that it's important to seek out professional help, that it can be chemically based, and that it's not a matter of not trying hard enough.So many readers loved this book, as evidenced by its overwhelmingly favorable reviews. But it's just not for me. This is the second book I've read by Matt Haig, and I've had trouble connecting with both. So I think it's time I part ways with this author and just accept that we are not compatible.For almost three years I have resisted. Friends told me to read this. Goodreads told me to read this. You'll like it, they promised. But I didn't like How to Stop Time and I didn't finish The Humans, I replied. Shh, this one's different.It sounds like one of those books where a depressed person with lots of regrets decides their life has worth because if they'd made different choices, they'd still be unhappy.Oh no, it's not that.Sorry, but it is kinda that. The best thing about this book is that it's a super quick read with really short chapters. But I am too cynical for this kind of story. The Midnight Library is a very self-helpy novel with a number of cliche messages at its heart. On the night Nora Seed (because she will experience growth!!) feels suicide is the only option left, she wakes up in a library filled with books, each book containing another of her lives, a path unchosen in her root life. Of course, as she explores each one of her regrets, they contain a message that, basically, regrets are stupid and there are good and bad aspects to all possible paths.I'm sorry to all the people who liked this and are having to see me grumble. I shouldn't have done it because I knew, deep down, I would not like it. I am way past the point in my life where inspirational quotes in novel form work for me. To be clear, I am a suicide survivor and have struggled with my own mental health. If this book pulled people away from the edge, if it was the answer, then I don't want to be dismissive of that. Sometimes what feels cheesy to one person is a genuine lifesaver to someone else. I am just trying to articulate that this magical in-between idea does not work for me personally. I think, perhaps, when it comes to mental health, I appreciate a more realistic approach and not magical solutions that don't exist in reality.My mind is blown; my soul is lit and I am happier.\"She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.\"(In one of her many lives)...\"I think you might have lost your way a little bit.\"\"Isn't that why I came to the Midnight Library in the first place? Because I had lost my way?\"\"Well, yes. But now you are lost within your lostness.\"This story is so fascinating and one of the most amazing stories that look into life, dissect it and offer too many chances to live in each making us wonder what could have been if we we're given a chance to live in each.It talks about regrets, relationships, dreams, pets, friendships and other relationships, what-could-have-beens and most importantly how to live in the present and make the most use of it. The writing is amazing and picks up really fast. Once you get into the book, it's hard to put it down. A thought provoking story, it will make you wonder things about your own life and what you could have been in the infinite other universes. It makes me believe that I can do so much in my life at the moment and learn what I could have done from the things that happened instead of regretting about it. A must read. It will make you want to have a hard look at your life and make you think about the many unimportant things that you've been worrying about all your life and instead make you want to focus on the things that really matter.A sci-fi, fantasy, contemporary kind of writing makes the narration so effortless, fast-paced, interesting and intriguing.Loved it.Unpopular opinion! In between life and death is a library, The Midnight Library. With books curated just for you..You will start with “The book of Regrets” your regrets, which could be “not telling your father you loved him before he died”, not marrying a certain sweetheart or not following a dream. Select another volume and see how a different choice may have played out.Discover that an alternate choices may not have necessarily led to a different outcome.This is a MAGICAL premise! But, I must be honest. As much as I wanted to LOVE this, I just wasn’t AS riveted by the explorations of “what could have been”. This will appeal to those who enjoy stories which revolve around sliding doors, alternate realities and time travel. That isn’t me. I gravitated toward it because of the appeal of the library.We all know that books resonate (or don’t resonate) with readers based on our own personal experiences. Perhaps if you share a certain regret with our leading lady, Nora, you will connect with this book more than I did. Perhaps, it was just timing.This book has almost all 5 star reviews, so please read others for an alternate opinion. Or, if you are one of the few, who like me, LOVED the idea more than the story, know now that there is at least one other person who felt the same way as you.What a shame - this could have been such a great novel if the author had the capacity to write about the issues of regrets and suicidal thoughts with maturity, complexity and depth. Instead, we get this young-adult-like novel in which the main character behaves and thinks like a 15-year-old, and every other character around her is just a cardboard poster rather than a human being. This is not what I expected from Matt Haig, whose previous books I recommended to people who wanted to understand depression. It's like it isn't the same author at all. I can't believe how silly and superficial its treatment of its topics is. Even with the fantastic elements of the premise, this could have been so much better.(4.5?) After loving The Humans, I was very excited for this new release and I wasn't let down!The main character is full of regrets after attempting suicide and ends up in a library where she gets to try all the other lives she could have lived.This books was heartbreaking and unputdownable. My main regret is starting it late at night because I had to wait until the next day to finish it!The writing was beautiful and hit almost too close for comfort. I can't recommend it enough!The only portion that made me nervous was towards the end. I'm always wary of the \"a husband and a child will fix this woman\". Luckily, it wasn't the case!okay WOW. This was amazing.I must say that I was kind of skeptical? going into this because the idea is SO good that I didn't know if the writing would be able to live up to it (which can sometimes happen)... but alas, no! Haig's prose is fast-paced and easy to read, but also believable and deeply philosophical. There is just so much to learn from this book. I mean, you COULD read a self-help book on stoicism, or you could just read this :)I think this is a really deeply personal book, and it's definitely one that resonated with me. It is kind of part self help book and part story, but that was why it meant a lot to me. I think I'd love to reread it to fully get its message. I can see why people wouldn't like it, but I can also see why it'd be really meaningful to a lot of people. I fall on that side.Corny like a Hallmark movie and probably the least subtle book I've ever read.Update: for those butthurt about my sentence-long review I just wanted to say that as a person who also struggles with depression, this book will become my 13th reason if y'all keep trying to defend it to me (jk)This was cute and the concept was great but unfortunately it really lacked some depth for me!So, first of all, HUGE thank you to goodreads for featuring my kindle highlights and notes for this book - wow. I never would've expected such an amazing opportunity to share my love for this book NOR would I have expected to \"meet\" so many wonderful people through the comments. It's been so much fun and I'm definitely doing more highlights/notes soon!!\n  The Written Review\n\n  \nLife has just gotten to the point where it's overwhelming and all-encompassing and above all, Nora can't see a possible situation where it gets better. Everyone she's ever known has pulled away, her job is gone and her best friend in the world passes. All she's left with is herself and a cripplingly black hole.She slips herself a few too many pills and then drifts...and finds herself in a library.Not just any library though, the Midnight Library.Guided by a person who may (or may not) be Mrs. Elm (young Nora's favorite teacher), Nora begins to take a look at the shelves.And every book is her. Well. A version of her. Other lives that she could've lived, decisions and paths she could've pursued.If you could undo any and all \"bad\" decisions you make, would you?In short, this book was amazing. Really, truly.I struggled to write my summary cause I didn't want to give too much away - so much of my joy of this book comes from just discovering where this story led.The world-building and the writing were phenomenal. It felt like I was marking a new quote on every page cause so much of it was THAT good.Nora's character felt so real and she got me all teary so many times. I loved the ethereal magic of the Midnight Library and the various mind-bending scenarios that Nora went through. All in all - this book was amazing and I could not recommend it more!\nJust posted my Goodreads Choice 2020 Reaction Video on Booktube! Click the link to check it out!!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_readsThis is a quaint little book. A quick read that I enjoyed. It is another form of the Groundhog Day plots that I have read this year. The library in this book is an infinite number of lives not taken. The opening is a little depressing, but it has to be to establish the motivation for the rest of the story. Even so there is a continued darkness in the tone. With each life to which the character ventures she only has to not like it in order to move on to the next. She is in constant search of that perfect life. The conflict of the book is set by page 38 and the pace increases. I am in constant search of the “Fictive Dream,” where I get buried in the story and the rest of my world falls away. The structure of this book, the constant shifting from life to life gives the story an episodic feel. This story is an odyssey and the character evolves as she comes to realize what life is really all about.¡Me gustó bastante! Creo que mi único \"problema\" es que terminé sintiéndolo como... muy motivacional (pero muy EN TU CARA).Nora has a rough 24 hours, and she thinks her life is not worth living. She finds herself in a library where she can pick a book where her life would be different than her current life. Will Nora ultimately find the answers she is looking for? What about happiness?Sorry, this book has received absolute rave reviews, but this book was not for me. I found it extremely boring and unoriginal. There was a movie ages ago called \"The Family Man\" with Nicolas Cage which has an incredibly similar plot. The MC wakes up and finds himself married to his long lost love and is the father to two or three children. Nora spends a good deal of the book complaining about her life. I am surprised that she didn't try to bump herself off earlier if just a bad 24 hours is all that it takes to tip a person over the edge. Many people have horrible, no good, very bad days. They don't jump to the conclusion that life isn't worth living! Why was The Family Man better? Because it focused on one alternate life. He had built up relationships. In The Midnight Library, Nora tries on so many different lives that deep, meaningful relationships were not developed. There were some quotes in this book that I enjoyed. Also, I am absolutely obsessed with Walden by Thoreau, and he had quite a few mentions.Overall, not worth the hype, largely forgettable, and a better investment of your time and money would be to watch The Family Man.2023 Reading ScheduleJan Alice in WonderlandFeb Notes from a Small IslandMar Cloud AtlasApr On the RoadMay The Color PurpleJun Bleak HouseJul Bridget Jones’s DiaryAug Anna KareninaSep The Secret HistoryOct Brave New WorldNov A Confederacy of DuncesDec The Count of Monte CristoConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook InstaA sojourn of a human to the multiverses through a library, which is as normal as this bizarre world without an exit to trap us there. Nora Seed might seed our mind with melancholy and heart with love in her quest for perfection. Can perfection be attained through the careful movement of the pawns in this deliberate game of life? Through the underlying current of sadness, this literature transcends us to a library between the universes with a librarian who is a mental metaphor that can be fathomed only by a few. “Aisles and aisles of bookshelves, reaching up to the ceiling and branching off from the broad open corridor. Books were everywhere. The shelves really did seem to go on forever, straight and long to the far off horizon. There were no title and names adorning the spines of the books.”  The library between life and death with a vagabond poacher through multiverses, who gave an open invitation to death and didn’t want to be preserved from death as she can’t decide how she wants to live. “You don’t go to death, but the death comes to you”  The fact that the day never ends due to the never-ending light is like living one terminal day. It is exceptionally depressing for an already depressed person who decided to die by traveling with her best companion - solitude from a society so lonely owing to the detachment due to the extreme social media attachment.Does life seem more attractive in the face of death? Is death the one that makes life beautiful? Is death an obligate parasite that wants to change the relationship to a symbiotic one with life?Is the simplification of the three-dimensional worlds by humans making it more complicated? “This is the wrong life. It is really, really, really wrong. Take me back. I do want to avenge. Take me back to the library.In the cosmic order of things, there is no rejection only redirecrtion.”  Can a person cry due to sadness, smile due to the speck of light at the end of the tunnel, and be surprised due to the philosophical brilliance at the same time. The reading experience of this book gives us that unique experience.\n  \n     “The thing that looks the most ordinary might end up being the thing that leads you to victory.” \n  \n—————————————————————————\n  You can also follow me on \n  Instagram ID - Dasfill  |  YouTube First Channel ID - Dasfill  |  YouTube Second Channel - Dasfill - Malayalam   |  Twitter ID - Dasfill1  |  Snapchat ID - Dasfill  |  Facebook ID - Dasfill  |  TikTok ID - Dasfill1 Are You Serious, Matt?Could it be true that clinical depression arises from bad choices and disappointments; or is it more likely the other way round? Or is it the case that depression is a consequence of environment, one’s less than sane immediate family perhaps; or possibly genetics, an historical aberration passed down from family far distant in space and time? Is the world an objectively depressing place; or made so by our attitude towards it? The philosopher Schopenhauer thought depression was an heroic human condition and promoted it by writing about it; Freud thought it was an illness and tried to cure it by talking about it.Haig thinks depression has something to do with regrets, that is, thoughts about what might have been if we had done things differently. And perhaps he has a point. In his view, regrets occur because of alternative histories we fabricate for ourselves in which disappointment with one’s lot is reduced or eliminated because life would be more fulfilling/successful/happy than the life one actually has. Depression, in other words, is a literary phenomenon. It’s a result of the what-if stories. Imaginative, articulate people, therefore, would be particularly susceptible to the condition. There is in fact substantial anecdotal evidence that this might be so (see, for example, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...)Based on this essentially linguistic theory of depression, Haig has a suggestion for therapy. At this point he crosses the line from playful fictional speculation to a less than savoury quackery worthy of Ayn Rand and Tim LaHaye. Haig thinks that some down-to-earth horror stories are just the thing to augment the happily-ever-after alternatives in our heads. Re-write the script, he implies, picking up all the tiny contra-indications of bliss because “undoing regrets was really a way of making wishes come true.” Or just remember that people, jobs, relationships, and desires change. Perhaps what was the case about these things when the alternative history was written hadn’t persisted. Or the outcomes remain the same despite different choices. Haig’s point, I suppose, is that things could be worse; that maybe Leibniz had it right: this world could be the best of all possible worlds. Disappointment with one’s regrets as a cure for regrets, and therefore a therapy for disabling, suicidal depression? Things could be worse!? That’s your therapeutic message? Are you serious, Matt?Haig even makes a pitch for a sort of group therapy in which those formulating alternatives to the alternatives get together for solace and encouragement. And of course he feels compelled to bring in quantum mechanics to bolster the non-literary reality of simultaneous lives - a cliché I was mightily hoping he might avoid. And the allusion to YHWH as the master of ceremonies (very Leibnizian), in the guise of a benevolent librarian, keeping all the disparate quantum selves in line is pretty cheesy. Ultimately Haig opts for the cheesiest of all criterion for the story one must have about one’s life: authenticity, we must be our realest, bestest, truest self. “Aim to be the truest version of you,” the godly librarian suggests, as if a depressive has a choice in the matter. I think Haig may have been to one too many EST seminars, or at least spent too much time in Southern California reading Heidegger on the beach.Of course in creating these new personal stories another issue eventually arises if one’s authentic self is the depressed wreck one started with. Then “It is quite a revelation to discover that the place you wanted to escape to is the exact same place you escaped from,” says Haig’s protagonist, brought back from the brink of suicidal death. But the important point, according to Haig, is “You just had to never give up on the idea that there would be a life somewhere that could be enjoyed.” Can one help thinking of Eric Idle’s magnificent rendition of ‘Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life’ in the Life Of Brian? Did I mention cheesy.I think it clear that The Midnight Library is a grave insult to those suffering from depression. It is a facile, trivial, misdirected, and (did I mention?) cheesy book. Am I entirely off-base in thinking Haig wrote it as a feel-good piece for those who just need a little pat on the back for their recovery from a bout of the blues, or a failed love affair? If not, you’re a louse, Matt.I got this before it came out but I was in a bad place mentally and it would have been dangerous to read. I'm better now, in a different life as it were, and it was exactly what I needed to read. Magical “Let’s be kind to the people in our own existence.” The Midnight Library is a book about choices, regrets, and embracing life. Nora Seed is having a really bad day. She is mugged, loses her job, blamed for other’s people’s failures, and her cat is run over by a car. She is also seriously depressed. This day is one of many bad days that Nora has experienced over the last decade of her life. She can’t take life anymore and attempts suicide.Nora wakes up to discover that she is in the space between life and death known as The Midnight Library. Here, Nora is given the opportunity to take the paths she didn’t choose and undo her regrets. She travels into the multiverse, getting to experience her other lives. What she finds is that the grass isn’t always greener, and in order to live, one must push aside their regrets and embrace their potential. “She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential.There are many versions of Nora, but she finds she is the same person in every life she chooses. She might be happier, but she doesn’t have what she needs, which is love. She cannot heal until she can open up and accept the love of others, but also love herself and recognize her value. I love Nora’s character. I felt all of her emotions, the dark, and the light. She is fragile, desperate, adventurous, a rockstar, a loving sister, a good friend, a kind neighbor, a good teacher, and, most importantly, a survivor.This is my first book by Matt Haig and I love how he weaves in bits of magic, fantasy, and whimsy alongside Quantum physics, literature, and philosophy.This is an emotional read. Reading about a character who is in such a desperate state of mind that they attempt to take their life wasn’t easy, but the other side of this book offers a lot of love, warmth, compassion, and healing. It was surprisingly heartwarming and uplifting.  Nora’s story inspired me to turn off the channel of regrets that often fill my head and embrace the here and now.I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Penguin Group in exchange for an honest review.This is the ultimate “what if I had done it differently?” story. I guarantee it will make you think and might give you some new perspective on life. Also, while it starts a bit dark, I think people who are looking for a way out of a dark place might find this story uplifting overall.I have been sitting here thinking about how to review this book and I don’t want to say too much about it because after 10 pages or so, everything little thing would be a spoiler! That, in itself, should probably pique your interest; it is so packed with interconnected and surprising content I can barely even talk about it! So, just read it because all the stuff that happens is totally worth it . . . I’ll leave it at that.I was hooked by this book from page one. It is not a long book and because it was written so well, it flew right by. If you are looking for a well written and unique story that I believe will appeal to people with a wide variety of interests, The Midnight Library is worth giving a try.2021 F.A.B. Bookclub pick # I.❤️. F.A.B. It’s incredibly rare that I come across a book that ticks all my boxes. Good characters. Great setting. Wonderful story. This book really lived up to the hype! 🤗 Nora Seed has regrets. In a moment of absolute darkness she decides she’s done with life. Trigger warning: suicide attempt. 😬 She’s pushed into The Midnight Library, where her school librarian greets her and explains the books of regret. Nora opens a book and lives a life had she done things differently. Book after book, life after life, she discovers who she could have been. ❤️ This book was beautifully magical and inspiring. I’d recommend this to anyone and everyone!! It is AMAZING!! ❤️📚3.75 stars. I love how unique this concept is, the conversation around mental health, and that it made me so introspective about my own life while reading it. I was so hooked when Nora went into the first few alternative lives but towards the end I started to get a little bored with lives 4+ (I felt like I already got the point in the first 3 lives). And I thought the ending was very predictable but I also can't imagine it ending any other way!So overall a little slow in the last third but love love love the concept and the messaging on regrets, life, and kindness.I ABSOLUTELY, TOTALLY, UNEQUIVOCALLY LOVED THIS BOOK!!!Who hasn't had regrets - wished they'd taken a different path in life, loved more and hated less, studied a little harder, applied themselves a bit more, had more faith in themselves, wished they'd liked themselves for who they were instead of what others wanted them to be?I'm certainly not immune, and I've actually fulfilled a couple of my life's ambitions, but life is not easy for any of us. As Nora was to discover, we all \"fear life\" to some degree - we learn pretty young that actions can have pretty painful consequences. Some of us stare that fear in the face and do what frightens us anyway. Many more of us, however, will step back and opt to take the safer road. I loved the notion of Nora being able to insert herself in a parallel timeline and see how her life would have been like had she taken a chance on all of those potentially life changing events. The whole parallel universe notion was so tantalizing! Imagine if you, too, could examine and then finally burn your own Book of Regrets and just move on with living your best life now?The first third of this novel is heavily mired in depression. If you've never felt stuck or depressed, you will certainly get a clue of what it feels like after you've read or listened to those first few chapters leading up to Nora's attempted suicide. There was a history of depression in Nora's mother's family. I was not surprised that Nora fell into depression after taking care of her mother during her long, protracted illness. Death has a way of stopping the clock for the survivors and making them examine the value of their own life. I suspect there will be many who will identify with most of what Nora thinks and says in this novel. Nora's Midnight Library is guarded and managed by her beloved childhood mentor and high school librarian, Mrs. Elm. There are several chapters devoted to Mrs. Elm's struggle to get Nora to try to experience one of the parallel lives in her Midnight library. This reflects the very real battle that a person with depression must face to get to the point where they can finally admit that they need help to get \"unstuck.\" Matt Haig has given a whole new meaning to the word \"potential.\" I totally agreed with Nora's final decision at the end of the book. In fact, I saw it coming even before she had completed her first journey. We can't live someone else's life. The choice must truly be our own if we want any abiding sense of fulfillment.This author - this book - has a lot to teach us. I am so very glad that I decided to check out what all the hype was about: turns out, all that hype was fully merited ! Loved every bit of it, including the sad parts. A full five out of five glowing stars for this heart-stirring, sanity-saving novel. We all need to burn our own book of regrets... and just get on with living our best life NOW! Highly, highly recommended!Note: I listened to the audiobook version, very ably narrated by the British film actress, Carey Mulligan. . . . . . . . . .You can check out this and other reviews on my partnered blog: https://crossingthepond.reviews/are the 10 most popular books of 2021 according to goodreads worth your time?\n  'if you aim to be something you are not, you will always fail. aim to be you... the truest version of you.'\nquietly profound and deeply meaningful.very 'the five people you meet in heaven' with a magical, bookish feel. perfect for anyone who had ever wondered if their life is enough.↠ "

        "synopsis": "A poignant, charming novel about a crime that never took place, a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air, and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imaginedLooking at real estate isn't usually a life-or-death situation, but an apartment open house becomes just that when a failed bank robber bursts in and takes a group of strangers hostage. The captives include a recently retired couple who relentlessly hunt down fixer-uppers to avoid the painful truth that they can't fix up their own marriage. There's a wealthy banker who has been too busy making money to care about anyone else and a young couple who are about to have their first child but can't seem to agree on anything, from where they want to live to how they met in the first place. Add to the mix an eighty-seven-year-old woman who has lived long enough not to be afraid of someone waving a gun in her face, a flustered but still-ready-to-make-a-deal real estate agent, and a mystery man who has locked himself in the apartment's only bathroom, and you've got the worst group of hostages in the world.Each of them carries a lifetime of grievances, hurts, secrets, and passions that are ready to boil over. None of them is entirely who they appear to be. And all of them—the bank robber included—desperately crave some sort of rescue. As the authorities and the media surround the premises, these reluctant allies will reveal surprising truths about themselves and set in a motion a chain of events so unexpected that even they can hardly explain what happens next. Humorous, compassionate, and wise, Anxious People is an ingeniously constructed story about the enduring power of friendship, forgiveness, and hope—the things that save us, even in the most anxious of times.Includes short story - The Last Round of GolfFredrik Backman is the #1 New York Times bestselling author of A Man Called Ove (soon to be a major motion picture starring Tom Hanks), My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She’s Sorry, Britt-Marie Was Here, Beartown, Us Against You, as well as two novellas, And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer and The Deal of a Lifetime.

My thoughts: the book is still so much better! This is my goodreads 2020 choice as best fiction novel! It came at the second place and I adored “ Midnight Library” too. But this one still has special place in my heart! It’s still my favorite fiction reads of the year! Good news: This amazing is about to be adapted in Swedish series. And fingers crossed, I hope Netflix buys this limited series so we may enjoy them! This is one of my favorite, highly recommended fiction novels of 2020! I think my vocabulary is so limited to express how this book made me feel. Yes, it shook me so hard but it also entertained the hell of me. It was tragic, tear jerker, but it was also funny, enjoyable, witty! It was action packed, riveting, heart throbbing but it was also thought-provoking, complex, dazzling, deceptive, educational and heartfelt.I know you got confused. How a book makes laugh so hard and then makes you cry like a baby and also hooks you up from its riveting, exciting chapters and at some parts you want to stop, taking a deep breath to absorb what you read, aching for characters, feeling their pain but you’re also laughing their ridiculousness! This book captivates your heart, brain and your soul at the same time and plays with your emotional balance, juggling between different genres and you just want to clap the author and take a bow for his remarkable, original, unique work.His sarcastic, witty and dark sense of humor reminded me of Guy Ritchie’s crime/dark comedy scripts (Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels and Snatch) and his quirky, sarcastic, awkward characters slowly warms your heart and entertains the hell of you! As soon as I finish it, I turned back and reread the police interrogation parts of the book and I laughed over and over!!!So what this book is about? Bunch of idiot people? YESAn unsuccessful bank robbery attempt and hostage situation? YES. What a minute! If the robbery is unsuccessful, how the thief managed to take hostages? And how many hostages he has? 8 hostages!Is this book about suicide attempts on the bridge? YES!Is this about stock markets, mortgages, banking system and destroying effects of capitalism makes rich people richer and makes you poor… yes, you may fill the blanks…! YES!I guess you must be confused again but don’t! Even though the book looks like a puzzle, all the pieces find their right place and so many twists that you may not foresee confuse you more but at the end you realize you read something so spectacular make you question your morals, your judgments, beliefs, the way you look at the life and test your decency.Jack and Jim, police officers, son and father, carrying Whiskey brand names, are anxious people who are not happy about their lives, polar opposites, barely stand with each other but unfortunately they are still colleagues and they’re interrogating hostages about the whereabouts of the bank robber. Oh sorry, the guy couldn’t rob the bank because the bank didn’t have enough money and young intern just called the cops so the unsuccessful bank robber runs into an apartment viewing. 8 people seeing the house become the worst bank robber’s reluctant hostages. But I have to admit they are the WORST BATSHIT CRAZY HOSTAGES you may imagine!Jack and Jim surrounded the building with their colleagues, called the big guns from Stockholm to save the hostages from another syndrome but they hear gun shot and when they go to check the building, they see the blood stains in the living room but amateur bank robber (you’re gonna understand my reasoning why I keep tell the robber this silly name after reading this book!) is nowhere to be seen. So Jack thinks one of the hostages helped the first time robber. Or they may hide something from them.So we’re moving back and forth between interrogations, the hostages’ back stories, secrets, the reasons behind they want to see the house. And naturally my favorite hostages are sarcastic, direct, cruel, smart, entertaining, cool Zara and golden-hearted Estelle (I wish she would be my grandma and her story broke my heart into pieces)The ending of the story (or let’s say new beginnings of the characters’ stories) was surprising but also heart melting, memorable, tear jerking. And I forget to add what this book is about… IT IS ABOUT REAL LOVE…Thanks to Atria Books/Simon Schuster for sending this special ARC to me in exchange my honest review. I love this author’s works so much and this is one of the best books I’ve read on 2020.medium.cominstagramfacebooktwitter a2 - 2.5 StarsI am definitely in the minority on this and I am very aware of that...all I can say is, Backman can really write (although I already knew that). And he can really write people. Which I also knew...The problem was I just didn't actually like any of the people here. Or the plot. Now, I'm not saying I always have to like all the people in a story to like the story itself. But when I not only dislike the people, but think they are completely obnoxious? And I think the plot is ridiculous and makes bumbling idiots of everyone involved?  And, yes, I am aware the characters were supposed to be bumbling idiots. The narrator calls them idiots multiple times throughout the book. It was a theme. After all, we are all idiots at what time or another, right? *wink wink* See what Backman I did there? *nudge nudge* (All throughout the book, mind you.) I know all the quirkiness was supposed to give me all the feels and and all that. Instead, it just grated on me. Now, to be clear, I didn't outright hate this or anything. As I said, the writing was superb. I thought there were a lot of cute moments and I really liked some of the narratives Backman explored about life, human nature, the human condition in a modern world, and anxiety as a whole. My love for those things just didn't offset my general sense of annoyance at the characters and the plot enough. But, oh well. As I said, I am definitely in the minority on this one. I know most people loved this. And if you think you might too, you should absolutely give it a go. I will definitely read more Backman in the future. This was just a miss for me, that's all.EDITED: Because I am sick of repeating this in the comments, I'm adding this here...I'm not stupid, folks. I understood why the characters were acting like idiots. I understand they were purposefully behaving that way to protect the true \"robber\". I didn't \"miss it\" and thus not like the story because of it. I understood what was happening. I \"got\" was Backman was doing. I don't need it explained to me. The characters - regardless of their motivations - just annoyed me and I did not like the book. It's that simple. I thought I made this clear enough in my review, but I guess not. Oh my, what an absolute gem this turned out to be! It's quintessential Backman: quirky, heartwarming, and uplifting.On the surface, Anxious People is a story about a bank robbery gone wrong. The bank robber, having failed at robbing a bank, bursts upon an apartment viewing and proceeds to take a group of unfortunate strangers hostage. This group of mismatched folks, each with their secret fears and mistakes, slowly open their hearts to one another, and as a result, find their lives inexplicably changed for the better.At its heart, this is a story that speaks to the humanity in all of us. No matter our backgrounds or experiences, we each have done the best we can with what we are given. We have messy feelings that go with our messy lives. We've made mistakes and all deserve second chances to redeem ourselves. That is what Backman has captured so deftly with his tale.Reading this book feels like digging through a treasure trove, with wonderful surprises at every turn. There's even a little mystery in here, when the police tries to reconstruct what happened, and things don't seem as straightforward as they initially thought. The mystery is really a small part of the story, but even that is superbly done and managed to surprise and delight me.Backman's writing style has always been quirky and his themes somewhat sentimental, but the two elements balance each other out, so that the quirkiness cuts through the cheesiness and helps to tone it down. The theme of this story, when you think about it, is really more sentimental than all the rest, so I found the writing to be even quirkier than his other books. I really enjoyed it, but I can see how this style wouldn't be for every reader or even every moment.I appreciate that Backman tries to tackle complex and timely topics in his books, and he does so in such an uplifting way. Especially now, when we live in a world more divisive than it's ever been, this story reminds us that if we only take the time to get to know the other side, we'd realize we are more alike than we are different. In my opinion, it's an overly optimistic stance, but it's still healing to be able to escape into this imaginary, wonderful world, even if just for a few hours.Anxious People by Fredrik Backman hit me right in the part of me that I never want to discuss, the part that I don't even know how to discuss. He knows how we feel at our lowest moments, during our biggest and smallest times of disappointment, grief, and feelings of despair. Yet, rather than bringing me down, he lightens my heart because we aren't alone in these feelings. There is humor in how we feel and there is hope in low times. This book made me laugh and I loved it. So now, watch me call all of us idiots because Backman makes such good points about the subject. We aren't alone in our idiot-ness, though. That could be beside the point or it could be THE point . Things happen, mistakes are made, but sometimes we can do things that alter the path of those mistakes before they become so destructive that we can't pull back from the black hole we are facing. There is a very reluctant bank robber-to-be and when attempting to rob a bank, the bank robber makes the biggest mistake a bank robber can make. So the failed bank robber runs and accidently takes an apartment of people hostage. The now hostage taker is having a very bad day, worse than the bad day they were having before they tried to rob a bank. And the hostages! The hostages are the worst! What is wrong with these people! We learn more about the hostage taker and the hostages and I loved it all. The two police officers, who later try to question the former hostages, are at their wits ends. The former hostages won't answer questions, they talk in circles, they ask their own very unhelpful questions, it's obvious that they are idiots and the police officers feel like they are idiots, too. How can so much go wrong and where is the bank robber/hostage taker? How did they escape from a closed area, with only one guarded exit. Just what is going on?Publication: September 8, 2020Thank you to Atria Books and NetGalley for this ARC.This is the most hilarious book I've read!A bank robber on the loose runs into the apartment across the street. In it, he notices an apartment door open. There is a showing for the apartment, and there are prospective buyers inside. He enters the apartment to clear his thoughts but finds that these are the worst hostages ever. Meanwhile, the police in this small town are hot on the trail of the bank robber. Will they be able to discover who is the bank robber and where to find him?Anxious People is very true, hilarious, and also moving at times. In my typical reading fashion, I practiced immersion reading (listening to the audiobook while following along in the printed version). The audiobook was amazing! I really enjoyed the entire performance and all of the different character voices. Anxious People also has one of the strongest openings that I have read. It is rare that I enjoy a book so much from the first chapter; however, this book was laugh out loud funny, starting from the very first chapter. There were some portions in the last half of the book that I thought dragged a bit but because this book made me laugh so much that I had to overlook that. Overall, if you are looking for a heart-warming, hilarious story, definitely give this a read!2023 Reading ScheduleJan Alice in WonderlandFeb Notes from a Small IslandMar Cloud AtlasApr On the RoadMay The Color PurpleJun Bleak HouseJul Bridget Jones’s DiaryAug Anna KareninaSep The Secret HistoryOct Brave New WorldNov A Confederacy of DuncesDec The Count of Monte CristoConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook InstaAnxious People by Fredrik BackmanThought-provoking, heartbreaking but amusing. It is a perfect mix of tragic and hilarious, believable and absurd. The whimsical & humorous writing style about real subjects like suicide, depression made this story remarkable. \n  God doesn't protect people from knives, sweetheart. That's why God gave us other people, so we can protect each other.\nSweet StoryThe thing about this book is that it is cotton candy-level, cavity-threatening, headache-inducing type sweet, and simultaneously very sad and real and filled with the most upsetting things about being alive.A real whirlwind.If you are in the right mood for this book (which I was when I started it), then it is a whimsical, amusing, life-affirming journey to becoming an optimist.But if you are not (which I suddenly shapeshifted into at some point), it is arduous to get through and kind of annoying.I personally prefer the version of myself that enjoyed this book, but unfortunately that version of myself only stuck around for a day or less and left the more powerful version of me to wade through this for the following 6 days.Still, I'd like to be an optimist. So...3.5 stars.But rounded down. I'm not Mary goddamn Poppins.Bottom line: Depends on whether you're nice or not!--------------------currently-reading updatesnot sure at this point if i'm even capable of reading without lily--------------------tbr reviewinsert joke about this being about multiple copies of MeDNF at 15%. The author tries too hard to be witty and quirky with a \"deep message\", but is neither funny or appealing. He uses an abundance of similes such as comparing children to kites (you hold on tight but the wind carries them off anyway) and fog is \"like someone setting fire to ghosts\" (has he actually set fire to one to know what it looks like?). My eyes were rolling. The witnesses to a bank robbery exhibit unrealistic and weird behavior (which is supposed to be quirky?). The 3rd person POV adds to the lack of appeal. Many readers love this author and this book, so do check out other reviews. I'm obviously the wrong reader.* I received an e-galley via NetGalley in exchange for an honest review*Updated 11/8/20* Buddy Listen with Kaceey! I'm so grateful that I got to share my love for this book with my book buddy and am so glad that Kaceey loved this book as much as I did. *5 Powerful Stars“Anxious People” is a thought provoking, heart-wrenching, comical novel that leaves you in wonderment. It’s Fredrik Backman at his best.  At its heart, this book deals with human connection and the impact people have on each other. It showcases Mr. Backman’s talent in an entirely new way and it is another reminder as to why he is one of my favorite authors. Fredrik Backman is an author who has an innate ability to capture the human spirit, get under his characters’ skins and relay his characters thoughts and feelings in a way that makes us feel as if we know them, as if we are friends with them and at times, as if we are them. “Anxious People” is different from Backman’s other novels, there are no quirky curmudgeons like Ove or Britt-Marie and there are no Benji’s. This story features a Bank Robber, a Hostage Situation, a Real Estate Agent and an entire cast of other extremely complicated characters. This is a character driven novel and it delves into the trials and tribulations of each individual whose lives are affected by the situation that they are in. I had no idea what I was in for when I dived in - what I will say is that each and every character will steal your heart. It’s that thing called human connection. Within just a few minutes of reading this, tears pricked my eyes and I knew from that moment on that this book was special. It is wild and crazy and unlike anything you’ve ever read. At times you will be exasperated and yet you will keep reading. One minute you will be laughing and the next you will be in tears. For me, it happened and happened often. Once again, Fredrik Backman does something special here and I’m so very grateful for it.  “Anxious People” is a must read and will most certainly be on my Goodreads Best of List for 2020. This novel reminded me that everything I do can potentially impact others and therefore, I must think before I act. It also reminded me how important human connection is and how grateful I am for the relationships I have built with all of you. Though times are difficult right now, I am thankful that we have each other. I wish you all good health, peace and safety. Namaste. A huge thank you to Ms. Ariele Friedman at Atria Books and NetGalley for the arc. Thank you also to Fredrik Backman for continuing to write such incredible words. You inspire me.Published on Goodreads on 5.9.2020.What will happen when a profoundly compassionate person decides to keep a bunch of crazy people as hostages? Fredrik Backman shows it marvelously through this novel.What makes this novel unique? Is it the elegance amid the chaos? Is it the hope of a better future amid the downright macabre of the present? Is it the humor amid the tragedy? Is it the author's prowess to make us smile and cry at the same time?This book is an artistic creation, which subjugates our introspection and overwhelms our contemplations on possible comparisons and interpretations. If you are an art aficionado, you are invariably going to relish the experience of reading this book. \n  \n    \"That's the power of literature, you know, it can act like little love letters between two people who can only explain their feelings by pointing at other people.\" \n  \n4.5 to było tak dobre!!\n  ‘we are doing the best we can, we really are...’\nthis message is the heart of this story.\n  ‘…we all have this in common, yet most of us remain strangers, we never know what we do to each other, how your life is affected by mine. when this day is over and the night takes us, allow yourself a deep breath. because we made it through another day.’\nand this is the heart of us readers.this is a story that will speak to everyone who picks it up - from the anxious to the confident, from the broken to the loved, from the young to the old, and everyone in between. the fact that FB can take such heavy topics about people and life and so respectfully explore them in a light-hearted way is still truly astounding to me. and its truly a testament to FBs writing skills that he can continue to construct stories that are relevant and not only resonate with, but emotionally touch, such a wide audience. this story is nothing short of the perfection FB consistently creates. ↠ 4.5 starsmove over beartownthere's a new sheriff in town. well, i guess that kind of depends on what you're in the market for. but this book came to me at the perfect place and time in my life. and something about that kind of serendipity makes this the superior book to me.you see, i was perusing the aisles of target, as one does. and i was looking for something that i had a. never read before and b. actually had interest in reading. and among the popular fiction, i found something to fit the bill. this pretty little yellow number. and despite some initial misgivings about the title of this book i read the inside flap and was intrigued. a book about a bank robber and hostage situation. score.but oh boy. it was really not about that. in typical backman fashion, this book is about humanity. the ugly sides and the hopefulness. all tied up in an interesting plot that had twists akin to a thriller. all while never venturing into preachy life advice territory. i'm realizing that this review is a bit of a mess. like me and like you. read this book, it'll likely make your 2020 better. ****FINALIST IN THE GOODREADS CHOICE AWARDS, EVERYONE SHOULD READ THIS BOOK, IT WILL MAKE YOU FEEL GOOD****This will definitely be a top 10 book for me this year!!I have now read all of Mr. Bachman’s books and have enjoyed them all. This book had me engaged from the very beginning.There are a handful of characters and they are all well developed. He is a genius when it comes to portraying people, their emotions, their habits, their “quirkiness”. This book reminded me of a Seinfeld episode. There are lots of things going on involving most of the usual cast and they don’t all get tied together until the end. I knew that there were underlying connections but I didn’t really guess all of them until they were revealed. As you know from the quite extensive blurb this is “ a poignant comedy about a crime that never took place, a would-be bank robber who disappears into thin air, and eight extremely anxious strangers who find they have more in common than they ever imagined.”I took a lot of notes about things that made me laugh but to share them would ruin the surprise for you, the new reader. I have never been so amused while learning lessons about life.“Everyone inside the apartment had their own complexes, their own demons and anxieties: Roger was wounded, Anna-Lenna wanted to go home, Julia was tired, Ro was worried, Zara was in pain, and Estelle . . .well . . .no one really knew what Estelle was yet. Possibly not even Estelle”Along with the narration of the events taking place there are also pages of interviews. After the event the police are trying very hard not to personally implode as they interview the hostages who really weren’t hostages!!! Why are they being so uncooperative????This book is best gone into blind, you won’t understand how incredibly well written it is until you immerse yourself in the story.If you have read any of Mr. Bachman’s books before, BUY THIS BOOK. If you have never read any of Mr. Bachman’s books, BUY THIS BOOK. There are some serious issues dealt with along with the lighter tone of the novel including: divorce, lack of leadership, father-son relationships, betrayal by someone you love, psychological problems including thoughts of suicide. I received an ARC of this novel from the publisher through Edelweiss.Backman does it again! I loved it!I could only assume the book was about me and my people 😁. In all seriousness, though, it is appropriate title because it is a character study and a character driven mystery. As you learn about the people along the way, you might learn a little bit about yourself.I love the way that Backman writes. He only has one book that I did not completely adore (My Grandmother Asked Me to Tell You She's Sorry). I am excited every time I see a new book is out from him and I cannot wait to check out some of his earlier works I haven't tried yet. If you have loved his writing before, I give you my 100% guarantee that you will 100% love this one.This was another Couch Time listen with my wife. We enjoy finding books we think we might both enjoy and we take time after the kids have gone to bed to listen to them together. It is my favorite time of the day! This was an AWESOME audiobook and I LOVED the narration. Marin Ireland is a fantastic narrator - I will be looking for more books with her narration in the future.Final verdict: very, very great! Read it!\nJust released my Top 10 Books from 2020 BookTube Video - now that you know this one made the list, click the link to find the rest!\n  The Written Review\n\n  \n  \n  \n  “Even if I knew that tomorrow the world would go to pieces, I would still plant my apple tree.”\n\n  Oh my gosh. \nLike most Backman books at this point...I'm at a complete loss regarding how to tell you that this book is, quite frankly, the best thing I've read all year.I'm just overwhelmed by the sheer goodness of this book...and if I were to try to summarize it...It would be:Failed bank robber takes on kidnapping role (unintentionally) and also kinda fails at it....but in a good way? Like a laugh-cry-laugh way.Oh gosh. Now I'm not making sense.Essentially, this book was amazing. But you really just have to read it yourself.As always Backman is able to instantly create fully-fleshed out characters from just a few sentences and he plays your emotions like a violin. I've never listened to an audiobook and had that serious of a yo-yo happening constantly - like there would be literal tears leaking out of my face followed by laughter. The way all of the characters came together and fed off of each other's energy was amazing. The way their pasts interwove with their presents was just as stunning. This truly was an amazing book and I cannot recommend it enough.\n  “That's the power of literature, you know, it can act like little love letters between two people who can only explain their feelings by pointing at other people's.”\nYouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_readsThis Swedish novel is about a hapless apartment viewing, a hapless bank robbery, and a hapless hostage situation. It’s a peculiar, stylized book with a brand of comedy that made me feel like I was watching a version of Amelie where she takes her neighbors hostage by accident. It’s a very kind novel. It's a very dark novel. It's a very light novel. It's a novel, it notes, about idiots.(and now I understand why readers, after finishing All the Crooked Saints, have suggested I try a Backman novel)I tried, I really tried folks, but I just didn't find it funny, compassionate or entertaining. So many of my friends are loving this one and I enjoyed reading their reviews on the novel but for me it was a tedious and an annoying read.  Looking back on the books I have read by this author I just realised I don't enjoy his humour. Having loved Beartown and And Every Morning the Way Home Gets Longer and Longer and disliking Britt-Marie Was Here,A Man Called Ove his humour is wasted on me. I thought this novel just trying to hard to be quirky and while I get the author’s attempts at mixing heartbreak and comedy for me it just didn't work and reading it was such a chore. I considered giving up at 50% but it’s a Blackman novel and I really wanted it to turn around but sadly for me this one was just too farcical. I especially hated the The Witness Interviews and found myself skimming through them.I didn’t enjoy the characters so really the book had no redeeming features for me. While I didn't like it I know I have friends who will love this one and I will be happy to pass it on. I am glad that this book is bringing joy to so many readers as it’s been a tough few months and humour is the best medicine. For readers who enjoy quirky and humorous novels you may love Anxious people.This book has restored my faith in humanity. It’s 1am and I just finished reading this book, and I really enjoyed it. Fredrik Backman is such an incredible author, he has such a great way with words and I love that he can write such a light-hearted story about such a serious subject. Here are some notes I jotted down while reading, as well as some of my favorite quotes: tw: suicide, death of a loved one, depression, suicidal thoughts •The way this book talks about anxiety and depression just really hit me, it was all so relatable •This book feels so light-hearted but it deals with such heavy subject matter, and I just love his writing, not many authors can have this perfect balance like this •I love the relationship between the father and son who are both cops, they were so soft and adorable •All the characters are so well fleshed out•I like the way the timeline jumps back and forth and includes interview clips •The audiobook is fantastic •The ending made me tear up a bit 😭•I love the theme of this book: we are all just doing our best and nobody really knows what we are doing •”Our hearts are bars of soap that we keep losing hold of; the moment we relax, they drift off and fall in love and get broken, all in the wink of an eye. We’re not in control.” •I love the discussion in this book about parenthood and how far parents will go to keep their children safe, and I love the quote: “parents are defined by their mistakes” because I think it’s super thought provoking and interesting •”It’s so damn difficult to admit that something is... broken. That it’s an ache is our soul, invisible lead weights in our blood, an indescribable pressure in our chest. Our brains are lying to us telling us we’re going to die”Well, this book is one of his best so far. One of his most popular books didn't work for me. But I had a right vibe about this one and I was so, so, so crazy about its release ever since I saw the cover reveal. And yes, this book is going to be adapted as a TV series! I mean just do it 🖤The story is about, yes, a few idiots who got in a weird situation while checking out an apartment (for that matter a not-so-functional cheap one). An idiotic bank robbery attempt with the bank robber ending up with a real estate agent, an old lady, a lesbian couple - one of them pregnant, another couple always in a fight mode, a rabbit man (don't ask me how he fits here), two more characters who works in banks. Two police officers trying to crack the identity of the bank robber. A most likely hostage situation. A most unlikely outcome. Lots of pizza love sharing. Lots of more love and support for the culprit. But anyone can be the culprit. And yes, that's the plot. I cannot believe I would ever read a book like this which I would whole heartedly cheer for the culprit. And you will know why the characters in the book do too. This is such a heartwarming and, yes, a heartbreaking read (as always with his books!). I didn't cry while reading the book. But the last page broke me. And yes, I felt the 5 🌟 tears when the book ended. The writing is full of dry humour, satirical and yes, trying at times. Now and then I felt so bored (yes, why?! How come?!). You might feel the same as well. I assure you it's been deliberately written this way. And oh, you will be so glad you didn't skip these parts. Otherwise, don't tell me I didn't warn you, you might go back to these pages to get the best out of this read. But yes, pay attention to the details. Pay attention to the irritating, annoying behaviour and dialogues of these certified idiots. You won't regret knowing them.Partly suspenseful, partly investigation room drama, partly hostage scenario, partly dramatic and partly narrations of each of these characters and partly how their biggest life issues get resolved in the end, this book is so incredibly well written. Not all stories are with answers, not all marriages are made in heaven, not all father-son relationship is that amazing, not all perfect stories are perfect. This story represented well our shortcomings, our disparities, our faults, our adult lives which aren't so perfect. The characters represent well our weaknesses and strengths, our disappointments and then what we could do to actually become who we are. I just love how character driven this story is. Multiple characters that work out really good. I say, amazingly written.Each of the character has been well represented. There's both character growth and the plot is well etched out. The ending is almost like a fairy tale. It's perfect. Trigger warnings for suicide and suicidal acts, anxiety, infidelity.Treat yourself with this book! I love both the Atria and the Penguin editions!!!🖤I was so so so anxiously waiting for this one 🧐😳😲 and yes, this book is sooooo well done!!!! I am so happy I ended up rating it a perfect 5 🌟 a day after reading it. And I am so glad I didn't write the review just after I finished reading it.Fredrik Backman demonstrates with style and panache his remarkable and astute understanding of what it is to be human in this profound and philosophical locked room mystery that beguiles in how it pulls at our heartstrings, with its emotionally charged heartbreak, tragedy, humour and in the joy of human connectivity. He creates a host of stellar and diverse characters, including a rabbit, anxious, with messy and chaotic lives, and their idiocy, not only their idiocy, but all of our idiocy too. This is the perfect read for our troubled times, resonating deeply at so many levels, and if you don't connect with it immediately, I urge you to stick with it, the pay off will come in spades. When everything goes wrong for a bank robber, he ends up holding a group of hostages at an apartment viewing.In this character driven narrative, with its maze like twists and turns, there are surprises as we learn of the stories of these characters, each of whom are skilfully developed. When the police storm the apartment, the bank robber has disappeared, what happened? The characters are interviewed, but all to little avail. Backman's storytelling is full of hope in how it zeroes in on the state of the human soul, outlining the incomparable value of kindness, understanding, humanity, forgiveness and compassion in a world of human idiocy. I found this novel to be reading of the highest order, so entertaining, with the ability to make you laugh and cry. It is a touching novel that cements Backman's reputation as a terrific must read author, smart, offbeat and imaginative. I have no hesitation in recommending this highly, I have no doubt I will be returning to it, time and time again in the future. Many thanks to Penguin Michael Joseph for an ARC.4+ starsI was anxious to read this book, good anxious, as in I couldn’t wait to read it. Fredrik Backman has been on my list of favorite authors since I read A Man Called Ove several years ago. I’ve have read all of his published books and I loved all of them. But when I started reading this one, I became anxious in another way. I was anxious because I thought I was going to end up not liking the book. It’s kind of a quirky story, bizarre at times. The narrator even says , “The whole thing is a complicated, unlikely story. Perhaps that’s because what we think stories are about often isn’t what they’re about at all. This for instance, might not actually be the story of a bank robbery, or an apartment viewing, or a hostage drama. Perhaps, it isn’t even a story of idiots. Perhaps this story is about a bridge.” ( From an advanced copy.)A failed bank robbery that turns into an apartment hostage situation and it felt just a bit over the top, but then, as he always does, Backman sneaks up on you and you’re laughing one minute and heartbroken the next and ultimately your heart is stolen. I’m not even going to try to relay the plot here. Fans of Backman will want to read it for themselves. I will say, though, that I definitely was not disappointed and in the end, my anxiety was unwarranted. Its moving and reflective of Backman’s astute sense of humanity. A humanity in all of its glory as these characters share their anxieties over the burdens that life doles out, and they open their hearts to each other. I was reminded of the parental love and anxiety over children that we saw in the Beartown books, of relationships between a parents and children, of relationships between husband and wives. There’s some of the same seemingly simple prose conveying something more meaningful than at first glance in this novel as in the others. The relationships that developed between strangers were perhaps the most poignant. Connections slowly unfold between characters and I felt myself slowly connecting to all of them, especially the bank robber. This felt personal and philosophical in many ways. The intimate tone reminded me of Things My Son Needs to Know about the World. I loved that Backman created these characters who made me believe at a time when I needed believing, that there just might be people who will do something even if it seems they shouldn’t, just because it’s the right thing to do. I received an advanced copy of this book from Atria Books . A special thanks to Ariele Fredman.Wow! That was fantastic! This book is about.....being human. I have only read one other book by this author and it was Ove. I am probably the only person on this earth that didn't enjoy that book. I was like what is all the fuss about? Umm yeah ...THIS....this right here is what all the fuss is about. This author is absolutely brilliant to be able to put this story together in the manner that he did. I am going to say one thing...Kevin Bacon...Nope Kevin Bacon is not in this book, but just keep that in the back of your mind...Let me know if you get it after you read this. Why did I love this book so much? Oh my gosh, there are sooo many reasons. It was so amazingly clever that you would be reading along thinking you knew exactly what was going on...and then I would literally stop dead in my tracks and go OMG...wow...really? Yet it all made perfect sense. It is such a well thought out progression throughout the story, that it simply amazes me that someone can dig in that deep and produce that for us. Yes, yes, I am now a fangirl, I admit.Here's a little what to expect without spoiling anything for you, because you will never forgive me if I did! Expect a bank robber who attempts to rob a cashless bank.. Hmm okay bank robber, I had no idea that was a thing either, so I am right there with you. The \"worst hostages ever.\" Man these hostages were entertaining. A guy wearing a rabbit costume (only the head) standing in his underwear smoking a cigarette. Yep that is an example of your hostages! SO entertaining, with a witty, snarky, dry humor...little snippets by the author- telling us not to think about cookies, aww now I want a cookie. We really got to see what made each character in the book tick. The character development was superb! The story was so unique, that piece by piece it fell into place.It constantly kept turning out one surprise after another. Super clever. ❤️Obviously....I loved it! Grab a copy as soon as you can, this is a must read! I can't thank Atria Books enough for this ARC in exchange for an honest review. This book knocked my socks off!Oh this one pains me, but I'm going to be the outlier on it. I am a fan of Backman. Read a number of his books, saw him speak in person about one of them, and even got to meet him and get a photo with him. Great speaker, engaging, and nice guy, the photo was his suggestion. When I saw he was to have a new book out, again I bugged my library so long ago about....and when it arrived I was number one in the queue. I dropped my other reads and immediately started it. And along the way....I almost DNF'd it.This one is the story about a bunch of idiots. Ok, so many reviews out there I'll just say there is a bank robbery that goes wrong. There are a bunch of people, idiots, who all come together for this story bringing in topics such as suicide, loniness, grief, cancer, love, anxiety, and more. Oh yeah and a hostage situation. With bumbling police. And, it was just too much, over the top for me. The 'interviews' the police tried to conduct with the witnesses were just obnoxious. I really didn't believe that all of these people treated the police like this and just would not answer them, just unbelievable. (Not that I believe people actually fly on magical brooms and play quiddich, but just different for me.) Perhaps this wasn't the right time for me to read this one. Perhaps I'm starting to gravitate away from Backman. I wasn't supper joyed with Beartown #2.I will also say I listened to the audio and it drove me nuts. The narration made the characters sound extra obnoxious, just waaaaaay over the top. It's funny, this narrator did another book this year which I absolutely adored and loved, loved, loved the narration. Just not for this one. Perhaps if I read print it might have been slightly different, not really sure. So why did I keep reading? Well,when I thought of DNFing and saw 213 people waiting I thought, finish it, it's just you. So I did, and I'm sure it's just me, or just not the right time.....but I will check out more from Backman in the future. Give it one more try.This author has a great talent and I will read anything he writes.I loved, loved A Man Called Ov so maybe my expectations were set a little too high on Anxious People. I did enjoy this book a great deal and would recommend it to anyone. The concept is unique, a bank robbery investigated by a father and son and their conflicts. This would’ve been five stars had the backstory of “The bank robber,” not been in second person. This structure not only stopped the forward motion of the story but for me it was like fingernails on a chalkboard. I have no problem with first person, third person and third person close, second person tossed me out of the story and held me at arm’s length.In the first part of the book the author doesn’t stay with anyone character long enough for the reader to relate to them. For me this is critically important for establishing what I need most out of a book, The Fictive Dream, a state where I become immersed in the story. During the opening pages of most books authors are tasked with endearing the reader to the character, what I’ve heard described as, “Patting the head of the dog.”The big reason this book works and is so popular is the author’s credibility, he is a wonderful talent who readers trust implicitly and are willing to give him a few pages to set up the story. The book really digs in on page 107 so hold out a little longer if tempted to put it down, you won’t regret it. Four out of five stars.David Putnam author of the Bruno Johnson Series “This was a story about many different things, but most of all about idiots. Because we’re doing the best we can, we really are. We’re trying to be grown-up and love each other and understand how the hell you’re supposed to insert USB leads. We are looking for something to cling onto, something to fight for, something to look forward to. We’re doing all we can to teach our children how to swim”. Love Fredrik Backman? Long time fan? Me too!New to Backman? His stories ... in the most raw sense of the word....are about humanity! “How do you manage to have such a long marriage? she asked”.  “You fight for it, Estelle replied honestly”.  “Julia didn’t seem to like that quite as much”.  “That doesn’t sound very romantic”.  “Estelle grinned knowingly.  “You have to listen to each other all the time. But not ‘all’ the time. If you listen to each other ‘all’ the time, there’s a risk that you can’t forgive each other afterward”.  “And that’s the weirdest thing about being someone’s parent. Not just a bank robber parent, but any parent: that you are loved in spite of everything that you are. Even astonishingly late in life, people seem incapable of considering that their parents might not be super- smart and really funny and immortal. Perhaps there’s a biological reason for that, that up to a certain age a child loves you unconditionally and hopelessly for one single reason: you’re theirs. Which is a pretty smart move on biology’s heart, you have to give it that”. Fredrik Backman has an exceptional keen eye ...a brilliant light touch... for the way that tragic, comic, and tenderness mingle together. This book reminded me of how short life really is. During our journey we see changes, possibly the truth, hopefully love, and an openness for reconciliation. ...Touching and relatable .......Beautiful, quirky, playful, compelling, urgent, funny,and compassionate. Thank you Atria Books, Netgalley, and Fredrik BackmanOmg!! I love this author so much!! It took me awhile to quit crying so I could write a few words. This book gave me all of the feels and got plopped right on my favorites list! \n  This is a story about a bank robbery, an apartment viewing, and a hostage drama. But even more it’s a story about idiots. But perhaps not only that.\nI love each of the characters so damn much. They just stole my heart. This book is funny, sad, hopeful.... There is suicide. There is everything. I marked many pages. The book took me by surprise because I thought one thing was happening and things turned out so different and good and beautiful. This book also had me laughing on and off as well as the crying. I’ll leave a few more quotes and end it there. I look forward to reading this over and over. And I have to say, I wish I could find me a crazy, sweet group like this and be friends forever. \n  \"So now we all know each other! Lovely!\" Estelle declared, so delighted that she clapped her hands. And for such a slight person she could clap her hands surprisingly hard. Which isn’t a great thing to do in a room in which someone is holding a pistol, seeing as everyone thought that the sudden clap was a pistol shot and threw themselves down to the floor. The bank robber looked at the prone bodies in surprise, then, with a scratch of the head, turned to Estelle and said: \"Thanks. That was very helpful of you.\"*Then Roger looked around for something heavy to attach the note to, and eventually found a round object that seemed just the right density. That was how the police came to hear someone shout from the balcony again, and when Jack looked up, a lime hit him on the forehead. From a distance, that makes one hell of a bump.\nHappy Reading! Mel 🖤🐶🐺🐾BLOG: https://melissa413readsalot.blogspot....5 big lovely stars!“This story is about a lot of things, but mostly about idiots. So it needs saying from the outset that it’s always very easy to declare that other people are idiots, but only if you can forget how idiotically difficult being human is.”Jack is having a really bad day. A police officer, he’s investigating a bank robbery that wasn’t a robbery, that led to a hostage situation and a missing perpetrator. The witness interviews all have a sense of “who’s on first?” to them. Well, his day might not be as bad as the bank robber’s, who might have been shot, but has gone missing and so who knows? “The bank robber undeniably had a point. Not that this is in any way defense. Bank robbers, they can have bad days at work, too. Hand on heart, which of us hasn’t wanted to pull a gun after talking to a twenty year old?”This book is much more broadly humorous than his other works. But he still deals with all the important issues - the anxiety a parent feels worrying about a child, the anxiety one sibling has when another goes off the rails, the anxiety of being an adult, even the anxiety a stranger has for another soul in agony. I love Backman’s way of looking at the world, his ability to express things so perfectly. “Suddenly, you find yourselves living alongside each other, not with each other.” I found myself highlighting all sorts of passages, big and small. Backman employs an unknown narrator to talk to the reader, which works really well. The narrator actually empathizes not just with the characters, but with us, because we all share the same emotions, desires and needs. There are lots of laughs here, but also crying. Keep the hankies handy. I loved the ending and the twists that Backman used. It’s especially poignant that Backman lost a friend to suicide and has suffered from panic attacks.My thanks to netgalley and Atria Books for an advance copy of this book.Update - reading this for book club and it’s equally impressive the second time around. And I love the way he has the narrator speak directly to the reader, like breaking through the fourth wall in plays. 5 starsOK, so according to the author, this book is about a botched bank robbery, an apartment open house, and a hostage situation. That’s it. And most everyone in the story is an idiot. Again, author’s words. Does this sound like a must-read to you? No? It certainly doesn’t to me either. But I read it because I have faith in said author to deliver a great story no matter how boring the premise. Did I like it? Yes, I did. I actually loved it. And I loved it enough to put it in my potential “best book of the year” category (which only has one other book in it so far). Wow, this author. Fredrik Backman sure understands the human struggle. The struggle to survive, to connect, to love, to do the right thing by others, and to just live a decent life. He could take an empty room with white-washed walls, beige carpeting, no windows, and two people and turn the scene into a Pulitzer prize-winning novel. And he does it with humor. Ridiculous humor—my kind of humor. I laughed out loud many times during this story but cried throughout the last several chapters, which served brilliantly as the epilogue. Early on I read one of his novellas. I think I gave it a two-star rating. What the hell was wrong with me then? I never reread anything, but I’m going to reread that novella and see what I think of it now. More than 2 stars worth, I’m sure. This story is chock full of fascinating characters, 12 in all, I believe. Most of them are misfits—anxious misfits, and it was so captivating to follow them through this essentially one-day story. All at the same time this book is compelling, heartfelt, inspiring, and ridiculous. I can’t write well enough to really give this novel its due. Just trust me when I say you need to read it. It will be good for your soul.Thank you Net Galley, Atria Books/Simon and Shuster, and Fredrik Backman for allowing me to read an ARC of this book. Opinions are mine alone and are not biased in any way. 4,25 przepiękne prze"

        "synopsis": "Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices . . . Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets? A novel about all the choices that go into a life well lived.Somewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality. One tells the story of your life as it is, along with another book for the other life you could have lived if you had made a different choice at any point in your life. While we all wonder how our lives might have been, what if you had the chance to go to the library and see for yourself? Would any of these other lives truly be better?Nora Seed finds herself faced with this decision. Faced with the possibility of changing her life for a new one, following a different career, undoing old breakups, realizing her dreams of becoming a glaciologist; she must search within herself as she travels through the Midnight Library to decide what is truly fulfilling in life, and what makes it worth living in the first place.Matt Haig is the author of novels such as The Midnight Library, How to Stop Time, The Humans, The Radleys, and the forthcoming The Life Impossible. He has also written books for children, such as A Boy Called Christmas, and the memoir Reasons to Stay Alive.I liked this book until it suddenly decided to moonlight as a self-help manual, replete with messages that would look great and profound on an Instagram post next to a well-posed cup of coffee with those foam pictures on top. Or embroidered on a pillow — pick your poison.\n   “She realised that she hadn’t tried to end her life because she was miserable, but because she had managed to convince herself that there was no way out of her misery.”\nAnd these messages have the subtlety of a sledgehammer. Forget the readers figuring it out for themselves — no, the moral and the take-home points will be (didactically) in your face, loud and clear, even if it’s awkward and clunky and stops narration in its tracks. Case in point:\n   “As she switched to freestyle she realised it wasn’t her fault that her parents had never been able to love her the way parents were meant to: without condition.”\nSome of these platitudes would also feel right at home in the Hallmark holiday special movie:\n   “And … and the thing is … the thing is … what we consider to be the most successful route for us to take, actually isn’t. Because too often our view of success is about some external bullshit idea of achievement – an Olympic medal, the ideal husband, a good salary. And we have all these metrics that we try and reach. When really success isn’t something you measure, and life isn’t a race you can win.”\nAnd I’m just not big on self-help or motivational books. I find most of them cheesy and corny and really awkward and often so painfully earnest that I just can’t take them seriously. It’s just me - I guess I don’t have the right personality to appreciate them. And so I was not too happy with the turn the story took.—————\n  \nThe premise was interesting, and the beginning actually had me captivated. It’s a story of a woman who’s had her final straw - a whole bunch of final straws, really - and when gripped by the oppressive darkness of depression decides to commit suicide. \n   “Maybe she was just really crap at it. At life.”“She wanted to have a purpose, something to give her a reason to exist. But she had nothing.”\nThis may be why so many of even middle-aged people like reading Young Adult books — there’s something quite comforting about seeing a brand-new person, right at the cusp of adulthood, when all the possibilities are still there and no clocks have yet started ticking, and there is enough time and energy to regroup and move on to the road not yet taken. But Nora is thirty-five, an age considered way too late (especially for women, with that damn idea of a biological clock) to not have it all figured out. It’s not the time (at least for women) when the world is considered to be your oyster — it’s the time when you really are expected to have your shit together. And Nora most certainly does not. “Well, don’t hang about. Tick-tock tick-tock”, says a well-meaning stranger in that unasked-for-but-nonetheless-given bit of advice.\n   “When she thought about it – and increasingly she had been thinking about it – Nora was only able to think of herself in terms of the things she wasn’t. The things she hadn’t been able to become. And there really were quite a lot of things she hadn’t become.”\nIn that moment between life and death Nora finds herself in a library full of books that are the alternate lives she could have had — lives that would have stemmed from one different choice, one different decision. (Jo Walton’s quiet gem My Real Children had a similar premise, and it was wonderful). And the point is - once Nora finds a perfect life for herself in this endless tapestry of parallel and “perpendicular” lives, she can choose to stay in it and live it as her own.The logical place to start is to revisit all those regrets that weigh her down. And Nora has quite a few of those.\n  “Between life and death there is a library,’ she said. ‘And within that library, the shelves go on for ever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be different if you had made other choices … Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”\nAnd then, after a great beginning (which was not always easy to read given how well Haig was able to capture the snowballing depressing crap happening to Nora) we careen right into the didactic self-help book where each parallel life exists to teach Nora a lesson that sooner or later will be unambiguously spelled out so that we don’t get it wrong.\n   “She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.”\nAnd if you had any doubts about the ending, doubt no more. It ends exactly like anyone would have predicted at the beginning of that self-help turn, except it’s even more unrealistically saccharine than I even dared to anticipate. It takes a turn into that meaningless “let you be you” drivel that seems to say so much while actually saying very little. It becomes the cotton candy of advice - sweet but of little value.\n  \n\n   “She didn’t need a vineyard or a Californian sunset to be happy. She didn’t even need a large house and the perfect family. She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential. She wondered why she had never seen it before.”\nAnd all that relentless hammering of the “profound” message into to readers’ psyche interspersed with tired cliches makes the whole book eventually seem bland and repetitive and tedious and, honestly, a bit trite. \n  “I mean, it would have made things a lot easier if we understood there was no way of living that can immunise you against sadness. And that sadness is intrinsically part of the fabric of happiness. You can’t have one without the other.” \n2.5 stars. I did not sign up to read a self-help manual.But my opinion is decidedly in the minority — maybe I’m just a crusty soulless cynic. Oh well.————\n“You don’t have to understand life. You just have to live it.’Nora shook her head. This was a bit too much for a Philosophy graduate to take.”It’s a bit too much for this science graduate over here, too.——————Also posted on my blog.“The only way to learn is to live”Fuck, this book hit me so hard. I finished this book a few days ago and I haven't been able to stop thinking about it. It has one of my favorite themes or tropes in a book, where we follow a main character who at the beginning of the story is very depressed and possible suicidal and doesn't see the point of life, but then slowly throughout the story begins to build an admiration toward humanity and life. This book was so beautifully written and I love the way this book asks the question: what is the best way to live?“Between life and death there is a library, and within that library, the shelves go on forever. Every book provides a chance to try another life you could have lived. To see how things would be if you had made other choices… Would you have done anything different, if you had the chance to undo your regrets?”It's a really cool concept, that between life and death you enter the midnight library, where you get the opportunity to see how your life would've been different had you made different decisions. I think a lot about this, what my life would be like had I made different choices and wondering if I'm the happiest version of myself? This book forces you to ask hard questions, like what makes a life worth living? And are your dreams for yourself really something you want? I love the way this book talks about regrets and how most of the time our regrets are a load of bullshit of things that are out of our control and they are causing a major burden on our life. “A person was like a city. You couldn't let a few less desirable parts put you off the whole. There may be bits you don't like, a few dodgy side streets and suburbs, but the good stuff makes it worth-while.”Matt Haig is such a talented writer and there are so many passages and quotes I'm obsessed with in this book. Much like The Humans (one of my all time favorites) this book has you questioning what the point of life is and thinking how truly absurd life can be. But I feel like this book is much more serious than The Humans, there are trigger warnings for depression and suicidal thoughts in this book, and it was very very heavy on my heart to read this book, where as The Humans feels a lot more light-hearted and hilarious. \n  “It is easy to mourn the lives we aren't living. Easy to wish we'd developed other other talents, said yes to different offers. Easy to wish we'd worked harder, loved better, handled our finances more astutely, been more popular, stayed in the band, gone to Australia, said yes to the coffee or done more bloody yoga. It takes no effort to miss the friends we didn't make and the work we didn't do the people we didn't do and the people we didn't marry and the children we didn't have. It is not difficult to see yourself through the lens of other people, and to wish you were all the different kaleidoscopic versions of you they wanted you to be. It is easy to regret, and keep regretting, ad infinitum, until our time runs out. But it is not lives we regret not living that are the real problem. It is the regret itself. It's the regret that makes us shrivel and wither and feel like our own and other people's worst enemy. We can't tell if any of those other versions would of been better or worse. Those lives are happening, it is true, but you are happening as well, and that is the happening we have to focus on.”\nBut god damn, I loved this book. I cried a lot at the end. I'll be thinking about this book for a long time. I also filmed a reading vlog and I included this book, you can see that here: https://youtu.be/9NiJtrbogyoEverybody probably knows the premise of this book by now (I mean this book is everywhere): a library with an infinite number of books. The books of regret. You open one and it transfers you to the life where you didn’t make that particular regret. Was it marrying someone or traveling or maybe other little things.While I admit I don’t actively pursue parallel universes kind of books on one hand, and on the other, the main reason why I read this book is that I was choosing the best fiction this year (to vote in the GR awards), I was actually looking forward to it. Most of my friends on GR gave it 5 glowing stars. A book beloved by the majority... I had a high chance of enjoying it. Sadly, I didn’t.First, it was boring. I listened to the audiobook and the narrator wasn’t the best, honestly. Not that her voice was annoying but it was kind of monotone. It certainly didn’t help either that I was listening to Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine at the same time, in which the narrator was so animated reading the book.I also found all of Nora’s revelations and enlightenment typical. Like sure I already know that. The ending was also painfully predictable from the start. So when you can guess where the book is going, everything in between becomes not so interesting anymore, especially if you don’t care about the main character. Unfortunately, I found Nora dull. She wasn’t interesting as the main character and I couldn’t relate nor care about her and empathise with her story. I can’t believe she was this multitalented in fields that aren’t related whatsoever to each other. She could’ve been an athlete, a scholar or a musician. All successful. All are based on life decisions. I also think that she had the privilege of choosing such different options. Many don’t. I don’t mean by that the book of regrets but rather focusing on a particular career path from the start. For example, many parents don’t nurture their children’s interests like music or gymnastics for several reasons maybe they can’t afford it or they just don’t care. But Nora had so many options. Luckily, the book was short. I also didn’t hate anything about it, hence the 2-star rating. But at the same time, I can’t name anything I liked. Maybe one of the lives, in particular, was more intriguing than the rest because of the two characters we met and.. the concept. It didn’t help that the book got repetitive sometimes. The premise was much more promising than the book itself. The “message” was also pretty plain obvious. Yet many liked The Midnight Library, however. So it might be more of a “me and not you” kind of book. But let me tell you this: if you don’t find the parallel universes interesting to read about in stories, don’t read this novel. Don’t be fooled with “LIBRARY. MIDNIGHT LIBRARY. BOOOOOKS.” The library is just more of a metaphor. Most of the events in this book take place in the real world. And unless you’re interested in kind of self-help books (or motivational ones), don’t read this novel either. Because it’s more about what Nora discovered about herself and life, of course, by dealing with/trying to escape from her regrets.But then again, the majority liked this book so you might too and it's simply not my cup of tea. Yet, it was a dreadfully boring.Okay! No more words! This is one of the best sci-fi dances with fantasy which carries additional philosophic vibes novel of the year! I LOVED IT! ( this is not kind of toasting for the book and raising your glass kind of loving it. This is more like climbing at the top of the roof and declaring your love by shouting and howling to the moon kind of love. If you read the song lyrics of “ Howl” at the book you may probably understand why I feel so enthusiastic and why I’m writing a high volume review!) This book is not only about Nora Seed who is trapped in her life, seeing herself a failure, a disposable human waste who has nothing to achieve, will never be missed by anyone . It’s about regrets, unfinished plans, what ifs, approval of families, drugs, mistakes, giving up, realizing other people’s dreams, self regret, insecurities, self harm, love, passion and hate...When Nora tries to end her life, she opens her eyes in a library filled with books which contain different versions of her life story. If she finds the right book and most proper life she can live fulfilled and happy, that will mean she can be saved! Thankfully the librarian Mrs. Elm here for here just like she has done when she was a little girl who recently learned she lost her dad. Nora could be a swimmer, a rock star, a philosopher, a wife, a traveler, a glaciologist, a mother, winery or local pub owner. She can say “yes” to her ex and accept his offer to live in a small town and own a local pub. Or she can say “yes” to coffee offer of a nice doctor candidate Ash to pursue happiness and love. She can win Olympic medals or she can taste the tempting charm of fame with her songs she writes and performs all around the world. She can be everything or anything. But after living so much lives, nearly thousand different versions, will she find which is best for her and which life form will suit to catch the real happiness? Can she live without family members or can she handle losing her friends to death? What does she really want? What does she expect ? And most importantly will she learn to face the things she regrets the most? Because however she’s ready to start her fresh life with open hands, those clutches of regret always pull her back and prevent her to see what she’s really looking for! Beautiful, meaningful, dazzling, emotional, heart wrenching, poetic, realistic : these are the words which come to my mind after reading this book. Just like the definition of ideal life. Sigh...bloginstagramfacebooktwitterIt is no secret that Matt Haig has mental health issues, dogged by the darkness of depression that has taken its toll on his life. His acute observations and experience of his condition informs this exquisite, inspiring, compassionate and empathetic novel where he creates the concept of the midnight library, to be found in the spaces between life and death, to explore life, the issues that afflict our world, through philosophy and more, endeavouring to tease out what might make life worth living and a joy and what gives it meaning. The device used to implement his goal is the ordinary Nora Seed, who has lived her life trying to please others, who has hit rock bottom, suffering the loss of her cat, her job, overwhelmed by the burden of a lifetime of regrets, seeing no light in her life whatsoever. She is tempted by thoughts of suicide that has her ending up at the midnight library.The midnight library is magical, for a start, the library has a limitless number of books, and these books are far from ordinary, Haig sprinkles gold dust in each book, offering Nora the opportunity to see how her life would have turned out if each and every decision at every point in her life had been different. The books illustrate the endless possibilities that life holds for Nora and all of us. Nora explores each book, with inquisitiveness and curiosity, the widely disparate lives that could have been hers, no easy task as she has to slip into each new life with the complications of being unfamiliar with it and do so without alerting the other people present. It soon becomes clear that there are pros and cons to each book/life, to each decision and choice made, each life containing its own mix of despair, pain and regrets that must be accommodated and handled.Haig offers a touching narrative that speaks of the joys to be found in living, attained through Nora's eyes as she tries to untangle what really matters in life, putting life in context and perspective with all its ongoing changes, complexities, and an understanding no life is perfect in itself. In some ways, this is a version of It's A Wonderful Life, a favourite film for so many people. What I was so struck by is just how many readers might find this helpful for our lock down times, so many have suffered unbearable losses and illness, have had to face not seeing all those we love and mean so much to us, whilst being weighed down with worries and concerns about how to cope with fears regarding jobs, childcare, money and more. A beautifully nuanced novel that I am sure many will love as much as me. Highly recommended. Many thanks to Canongate for an ARC.Okay. Picture this: you are about to bite into a cookie. A big, warm cookie. Kinda crispy on the outside, chewy on the inside, yummy and chocolate chip-y and presumably made with brown butter and flaky sea salt, as all the best cookies are.And then you take a big ol' chomp, and...oh no. Not a chocolate chip at all.This cookie is filled with...RAISINS.Have you immersed yourself in that experience? Really felt the high expectations and the all-consuming disappointment?Good.Because that was my experience with this book.This is not a bad book, necessarily, just like raisin-y cookies are not a bad food. (They are closer to granola bars than cookies, but my favorite in the Chewy Granola Bar Variety Pack was always oatmeal raisin, like a six-year-old grumpy old man, so that's not a negative in my personal lexicon.)It's just that it could be much better. And I thought it would be.I thought this was going to be a magical realism-y (my favorite), book-filled (my favorite), beautifully written (everyone's favorite) romp through a brilliant new world.Instead, it was a very fluffy, very...done-before-feeling It's A Wonderful Life-esque feel-good discussion of suicide.(I mention this further down, but this is SO, SO triggering for suicide.)That's not a bad thing. It's just not what I wanted. Or needed. Or anything the genre really aches for at all.But whatever.Bottom line: I should bake cookies and reread The Starless Sea. Both instead of having read this and as a daily routine.------------pre-reviewfor a book with library in the title, and a library as the setting, and \"library\" four times in the synopsis, this had remarkably little to do with libraries.(also, this is massively, unrelentingly triggering for suicide. fair warning because i wish i'd been more prepared!)review to come / 3 stars------------currently-reading updatesstarted this and immediately realized i'm mentally comparing it to the Starless Sea already.both book + i are destined to fail.------------tbr reviewSomewhere out beyond the edge of the universe there is a library that contains an infinite number of books, each one the story of another reality.um.(deep breath)YESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYESYES\n  \"That is just me. I add nothing. I am wallowing in self-pity.\"\nNo truer words have been said by Nora, the world's largest wet blanket. Woe is her, folks.Nora ends up at The Midnight Library, a place between life and death, because she doesn't want to live anymore. The library is full of books, each representing a life she could've had, had she made different choices. Now she has a chance to undo all her numerous regrets and to try out all the lives she's missed out on, to see if there is another one she would like better.Lest you think I'm cold-hearted for not loving this, I assure you, I'm not. Normally, I love sappy, cheesy, inspirational mush. I watch Hallmark movies. I believe in soulmates and happily ever after. I cry during every sweet scene in every movie. And yet this book left me so cold inside, and I'll try to put into words why.For one thing, this story doesn't come across as fiction so much as self-help disguised as fiction. The lessons to be learned in here are pretty obvious right from the beginning, yet they are presented like some sort of epiphany that can only be understood if explained slowly and repeatedly. We are forced to endure these lessons over and over every time Nora goes back to the library. Either Nora is the most dim-witted of characters, or the author thinks us readers are.Another problem is that it's really hard to connect with Nora. She'll take a situation, suck every ounce of joy out of it, and interpret what's left in the most negative way possible. She's full of regret for every decision she's ever made, and thinks the grass is always greener. However, other than being negative, she literally has no other personality traits. She's a blank slate, dull and uninteresting. I also have issues with the core messages in this book. Nora finally learns her lesson, but only after having fixated on each regret, remade every decision, and lived all subsequent lives. I'm also uncomfortable with the implication that if you're depressed, you only need to change your outlook and you will feel better. That goes against everything we understand about mental illness, including that it's important to seek out professional help, that it can be chemically based, and that it's not a matter of not trying hard enough.So many readers loved this book, as evidenced by its overwhelmingly favorable reviews. But it's just not for me. This is the second book I've read by Matt Haig, and I've had trouble connecting with both. So I think it's time I part ways with this author and just accept that we are not compatible.For almost three years I have resisted. Friends told me to read this. Goodreads told me to read this. You'll like it, they promised. But I didn't like How to Stop Time and I didn't finish The Humans, I replied. Shh, this one's different.It sounds like one of those books where a depressed person with lots of regrets decides their life has worth because if they'd made different choices, they'd still be unhappy.Oh no, it's not that.Sorry, but it is kinda that. The best thing about this book is that it's a super quick read with really short chapters. But I am too cynical for this kind of story. The Midnight Library is a very self-helpy novel with a number of cliche messages at its heart. On the night Nora Seed (because she will experience growth!!) feels suicide is the only option left, she wakes up in a library filled with books, each book containing another of her lives, a path unchosen in her root life. Of course, as she explores each one of her regrets, they contain a message that, basically, regrets are stupid and there are good and bad aspects to all possible paths.I'm sorry to all the people who liked this and are having to see me grumble. I shouldn't have done it because I knew, deep down, I would not like it. I am way past the point in my life where inspirational quotes in novel form work for me. To be clear, I am a suicide survivor and have struggled with my own mental health. If this book pulled people away from the edge, if it was the answer, then I don't want to be dismissive of that. Sometimes what feels cheesy to one person is a genuine lifesaver to someone else. I am just trying to articulate that this magical in-between idea does not work for me personally. I think, perhaps, when it comes to mental health, I appreciate a more realistic approach and not magical solutions that don't exist in reality.My mind is blown; my soul is lit and I am happier.\"She realised, in that moment, that she was capable of a lot more than she had known.\"(In one of her many lives)...\"I think you might have lost your way a little bit.\"\"Isn't that why I came to the Midnight Library in the first place? Because I had lost my way?\"\"Well, yes. But now you are lost within your lostness.\"This story is so fascinating and one of the most amazing stories that look into life, dissect it and offer too many chances to live in each making us wonder what could have been if we we're given a chance to live in each.It talks about regrets, relationships, dreams, pets, friendships and other relationships, what-could-have-beens and most importantly how to live in the present and make the most use of it. The writing is amazing and picks up really fast. Once you get into the book, it's hard to put it down. A thought provoking story, it will make you wonder things about your own life and what you could have been in the infinite other universes. It makes me believe that I can do so much in my life at the moment and learn what I could have done from the things that happened instead of regretting about it. A must read. It will make you want to have a hard look at your life and make you think about the many unimportant things that you've been worrying about all your life and instead make you want to focus on the things that really matter.A sci-fi, fantasy, contemporary kind of writing makes the narration so effortless, fast-paced, interesting and intriguing.Loved it.Unpopular opinion! In between life and death is a library, The Midnight Library. With books curated just for you..You will start with “The book of Regrets” your regrets, which could be “not telling your father you loved him before he died”, not marrying a certain sweetheart or not following a dream. Select another volume and see how a different choice may have played out.Discover that an alternate choices may not have necessarily led to a different outcome.This is a MAGICAL premise! But, I must be honest. As much as I wanted to LOVE this, I just wasn’t AS riveted by the explorations of “what could have been”. This will appeal to those who enjoy stories which revolve around sliding doors, alternate realities and time travel. That isn’t me. I gravitated toward it because of the appeal of the library.We all know that books resonate (or don’t resonate) with readers based on our own personal experiences. Perhaps if you share a certain regret with our leading lady, Nora, you will connect with this book more than I did. Perhaps, it was just timing.This book has almost all 5 star reviews, so please read others for an alternate opinion. Or, if you are one of the few, who like me, LOVED the idea more than the story, know now that there is at least one other person who felt the same way as you.What a shame - this could have been such a great novel if the author had the capacity to write about the issues of regrets and suicidal thoughts with maturity, complexity and depth. Instead, we get this young-adult-like novel in which the main character behaves and thinks like a 15-year-old, and every other character around her is just a cardboard poster rather than a human being. This is not what I expected from Matt Haig, whose previous books I recommended to people who wanted to understand depression. It's like it isn't the same author at all. I can't believe how silly and superficial its treatment of its topics is. Even with the fantastic elements of the premise, this could have been so much better.(4.5?) After loving The Humans, I was very excited for this new release and I wasn't let down!The main character is full of regrets after attempting suicide and ends up in a library where she gets to try all the other lives she could have lived.This books was heartbreaking and unputdownable. My main regret is starting it late at night because I had to wait until the next day to finish it!The writing was beautiful and hit almost too close for comfort. I can't recommend it enough!The only portion that made me nervous was towards the end. I'm always wary of the \"a husband and a child will fix this woman\". Luckily, it wasn't the case!okay WOW. This was amazing.I must say that I was kind of skeptical? going into this because the idea is SO good that I didn't know if the writing would be able to live up to it (which can sometimes happen)... but alas, no! Haig's prose is fast-paced and easy to read, but also believable and deeply philosophical. There is just so much to learn from this book. I mean, you COULD read a self-help book on stoicism, or you could just read this :)I think this is a really deeply personal book, and it's definitely one that resonated with me. It is kind of part self help book and part story, but that was why it meant a lot to me. I think I'd love to reread it to fully get its message. I can see why people wouldn't like it, but I can also see why it'd be really meaningful to a lot of people. I fall on that side.Corny like a Hallmark movie and probably the least subtle book I've ever read.Update: for those butthurt about my sentence-long review I just wanted to say that as a person who also struggles with depression, this book will become my 13th reason if y'all keep trying to defend it to me (jk)This was cute and the concept was great but unfortunately it really lacked some depth for me!So, first of all, HUGE thank you to goodreads for featuring my kindle highlights and notes for this book - wow. I never would've expected such an amazing opportunity to share my love for this book NOR would I have expected to \"meet\" so many wonderful people through the comments. It's been so much fun and I'm definitely doing more highlights/notes soon!!\n  The Written Review\n\n  \nLife has just gotten to the point where it's overwhelming and all-encompassing and above all, Nora can't see a possible situation where it gets better. Everyone she's ever known has pulled away, her job is gone and her best friend in the world passes. All she's left with is herself and a cripplingly black hole.She slips herself a few too many pills and then drifts...and finds herself in a library.Not just any library though, the Midnight Library.Guided by a person who may (or may not) be Mrs. Elm (young Nora's favorite teacher), Nora begins to take a look at the shelves.And every book is her. Well. A version of her. Other lives that she could've lived, decisions and paths she could've pursued.If you could undo any and all \"bad\" decisions you make, would you?In short, this book was amazing. Really, truly.I struggled to write my summary cause I didn't want to give too much away - so much of my joy of this book comes from just discovering where this story led.The world-building and the writing were phenomenal. It felt like I was marking a new quote on every page cause so much of it was THAT good.Nora's character felt so real and she got me all teary so many times. I loved the ethereal magic of the Midnight Library and the various mind-bending scenarios that Nora went through. All in all - this book was amazing and I could not recommend it more!\nJust posted my Goodreads Choice 2020 Reaction Video on Booktube! Click the link to check it out!!YouTube | Blog | Instagram | Twitter | Facebook | Snapchat @miranda_readsThis is a quaint little book. A quick read that I enjoyed. It is another form of the Groundhog Day plots that I have read this year. The library in this book is an infinite number of lives not taken. The opening is a little depressing, but it has to be to establish the motivation for the rest of the story. Even so there is a continued darkness in the tone. With each life to which the character ventures she only has to not like it in order to move on to the next. She is in constant search of that perfect life. The conflict of the book is set by page 38 and the pace increases. I am in constant search of the “Fictive Dream,” where I get buried in the story and the rest of my world falls away. The structure of this book, the constant shifting from life to life gives the story an episodic feel. This story is an odyssey and the character evolves as she comes to realize what life is really all about.¡Me gustó bastante! Creo que mi único \"problema\" es que terminé sintiéndolo como... muy motivacional (pero muy EN TU CARA).Nora has a rough 24 hours, and she thinks her life is not worth living. She finds herself in a library where she can pick a book where her life would be different than her current life. Will Nora ultimately find the answers she is looking for? What about happiness?Sorry, this book has received absolute rave reviews, but this book was not for me. I found it extremely boring and unoriginal. There was a movie ages ago called \"The Family Man\" with Nicolas Cage which has an incredibly similar plot. The MC wakes up and finds himself married to his long lost love and is the father to two or three children. Nora spends a good deal of the book complaining about her life. I am surprised that she didn't try to bump herself off earlier if just a bad 24 hours is all that it takes to tip a person over the edge. Many people have horrible, no good, very bad days. They don't jump to the conclusion that life isn't worth living! Why was The Family Man better? Because it focused on one alternate life. He had built up relationships. In The Midnight Library, Nora tries on so many different lives that deep, meaningful relationships were not developed. There were some quotes in this book that I enjoyed. Also, I am absolutely obsessed with Walden by Thoreau, and he had quite a few mentions.Overall, not worth the hype, largely forgettable, and a better investment of your time and money would be to watch The Family Man.2023 Reading ScheduleJan Alice in WonderlandFeb Notes from a Small IslandMar Cloud AtlasApr On the RoadMay The Color PurpleJun Bleak HouseJul Bridget Jones’s DiaryAug Anna KareninaSep The Secret HistoryOct Brave New WorldNov A Confederacy of DuncesDec The Count of Monte CristoConnect With Me!Blog Twitter BookTube Facebook InstaA sojourn of a human to the multiverses through a library, which is as normal as this bizarre world without an exit to trap us there. Nora Seed might seed our mind with melancholy and heart with love in her quest for perfection. Can perfection be attained through the careful movement of the pawns in this deliberate game of life? Through the underlying current of sadness, this literature transcends us to a library between the universes with a librarian who is a mental metaphor that can be fathomed only by a few. “Aisles and aisles of bookshelves, reaching up to the ceiling and branching off from the broad open corridor. Books were everywhere. The shelves really did seem to go on forever, straight and long to the far off horizon. There were no title and names adorning the spines of the books.”  The library between life and death with a vagabond poacher through multiverses, who gave an open invitation to death and didn’t want to be preserved from death as she can’t decide how she wants to live. “You don’t go to death, but the death comes to you”  The fact that the day never ends due to the never-ending light is like living one terminal day. It is exceptionally depressing for an already depressed person who decided to die by traveling with her best companion - solitude from a society so lonely owing to the detachment due to the extreme social media attachment.Does life seem more attractive in the face of death? Is death the one that makes life beautiful? Is death an obligate parasite that wants to change the relationship to a symbiotic one with life?Is the simplification of the three-dimensional worlds by humans making it more complicated? “This is the wrong life. It is really, really, really wrong. Take me back. I do want to avenge. Take me back to the library.In the cosmic order of things, there is no rejection only redirecrtion.”  Can a person cry due to sadness, smile due to the speck of light at the end of the tunnel, and be surprised due to the philosophical brilliance at the same time. The reading experience of this book gives us that unique experience.\n  \n     “The thing that looks the most ordinary might end up being the thing that leads you to victory.” \n  \n—————————————————————————\n  You can also follow me on \n  Instagram ID - Dasfill  |  YouTube First Channel ID - Dasfill  |  YouTube Second Channel - Dasfill - Malayalam   |  Twitter ID - Dasfill1  |  Snapchat ID - Dasfill  |  Facebook ID - Dasfill  |  TikTok ID - Dasfill1 Are You Serious, Matt?Could it be true that clinical depression arises from bad choices and disappointments; or is it more likely the other way round? Or is it the case that depression is a consequence of environment, one’s less than sane immediate family perhaps; or possibly genetics, an historical aberration passed down from family far distant in space and time? Is the world an objectively depressing place; or made so by our attitude towards it? The philosopher Schopenhauer thought depression was an heroic human condition and promoted it by writing about it; Freud thought it was an illness and tried to cure it by talking about it.Haig thinks depression has something to do with regrets, that is, thoughts about what might have been if we had done things differently. And perhaps he has a point. In his view, regrets occur because of alternative histories we fabricate for ourselves in which disappointment with one’s lot is reduced or eliminated because life would be more fulfilling/successful/happy than the life one actually has. Depression, in other words, is a literary phenomenon. It’s a result of the what-if stories. Imaginative, articulate people, therefore, would be particularly susceptible to the condition. There is in fact substantial anecdotal evidence that this might be so (see, for example, https://www.goodreads.com/review/show...)Based on this essentially linguistic theory of depression, Haig has a suggestion for therapy. At this point he crosses the line from playful fictional speculation to a less than savoury quackery worthy of Ayn Rand and Tim LaHaye. Haig thinks that some down-to-earth horror stories are just the thing to augment the happily-ever-after alternatives in our heads. Re-write the script, he implies, picking up all the tiny contra-indications of bliss because “undoing regrets was really a way of making wishes come true.” Or just remember that people, jobs, relationships, and desires change. Perhaps what was the case about these things when the alternative history was written hadn’t persisted. Or the outcomes remain the same despite different choices. Haig’s point, I suppose, is that things could be worse; that maybe Leibniz had it right: this world could be the best of all possible worlds. Disappointment with one’s regrets as a cure for regrets, and therefore a therapy for disabling, suicidal depression? Things could be worse!? That’s your therapeutic message? Are you serious, Matt?Haig even makes a pitch for a sort of group therapy in which those formulating alternatives to the alternatives get together for solace and encouragement. And of course he feels compelled to bring in quantum mechanics to bolster the non-literary reality of simultaneous lives - a cliché I was mightily hoping he might avoid. And the allusion to YHWH as the master of ceremonies (very Leibnizian), in the guise of a benevolent librarian, keeping all the disparate quantum selves in line is pretty cheesy. Ultimately Haig opts for the cheesiest of all criterion for the story one must have about one’s life: authenticity, we must be our realest, bestest, truest self. “Aim to be the truest version of you,” the godly librarian suggests, as if a depressive has a choice in the matter. I think Haig may have been to one too many EST seminars, or at least spent too much time in Southern California reading Heidegger on the beach.Of course in creating these new personal stories another issue eventually arises if one’s authentic self is the depressed wreck one started with. Then “It is quite a revelation to discover that the place you wanted to escape to is the exact same place you escaped from,” says Haig’s protagonist, brought back from the brink of suicidal death. But the important point, according to Haig, is “You just had to never give up on the idea that there would be a life somewhere that could be enjoyed.” Can one help thinking of Eric Idle’s magnificent rendition of ‘Always Look On The Bright Side Of Life’ in the Life Of Brian? Did I mention cheesy.I think it clear that The Midnight Library is a grave insult to those suffering from depression. It is a facile, trivial, misdirected, and (did I mention?) cheesy book. Am I entirely off-base in thinking Haig wrote it as a feel-good piece for those who just need a little pat on the back for their recovery from a bout of the blues, or a failed love affair? If not, you’re a louse, Matt.I got this before it came out but I was in a bad place mentally and it would have been dangerous to read. I'm better now, in a different life as it were, and it was exactly what I needed to read. Magical “Let’s be kind to the people in our own existence.” The Midnight Library is a book about choices, regrets, and embracing life. Nora Seed is having a really bad day. She is mugged, loses her job, blamed for other’s people’s failures, and her cat is run over by a car. She is also seriously depressed. This day is one of many bad days that Nora has experienced over the last decade of her life. She can’t take life anymore and attempts suicide.Nora wakes up to discover that she is in the space between life and death known as The Midnight Library. Here, Nora is given the opportunity to take the paths she didn’t choose and undo her regrets. She travels into the multiverse, getting to experience her other lives. What she finds is that the grass isn’t always greener, and in order to live, one must push aside their regrets and embrace their potential. “She just needed potential. And she was nothing if not potential.There are many versions of Nora, but she finds she is the same person in every life she chooses. She might be happier, but she doesn’t have what she needs, which is love. She cannot heal until she can open up and accept the love of others, but also love herself and recognize her value. I love Nora’s character. I felt all of her emotions, the dark, and the light. She is fragile, desperate, adventurous, a rockstar, a loving sister, a good friend, a kind neighbor, a good teacher, and, most importantly, a survivor.This is my first book by Matt Haig and I love how he weaves in bits of magic, fantasy, and whimsy alongside Quantum physics, literature, and philosophy.This is an emotional read. Reading about a character who is in such a desperate state of mind that they attempt to take their life wasn’t easy, but the other side of this book offers a lot of love, warmth, compassion, and healing. It was surprisingly heartwarming and uplifting.  Nora’s story inspired me to turn off the channel of regrets that often fill my head and embrace the here and now.I received an ARC of this book from NetGalley and Penguin Group in exchange for an honest review.This is the ultimate “what if I had done it differently?” story. I guarantee it will make you think and might give you some new perspective on life. Also, while it starts a bit dark, I think people who are looking for a way out of a dark place might find this story uplifting overall.I have been sitting here thinking about how to review this book and I don’t want to say too much about it because after 10 pages or so, everything little thing would be a spoiler! That, in itself, should probably pique your interest; it is so packed with interconnected and surprising content I can barely even talk about it! So, just read it because all the stuff that happens is totally worth it . . . I’ll leave it at that.I was hooked by this book from page one. It is not a long book and because it was written so well, it flew right by. If you are looking for a well written and unique story that I believe will appeal to people with a wide variety of interests, The Midnight Library is worth giving a try.2021 F.A.B. Bookclub pick # I.❤️. F.A.B. It’s incredibly rare that I come across a book that ticks all my boxes. Good characters. Great setting. Wonderful story. This book really lived up to the hype! 🤗 Nora Seed has regrets. In a moment of absolute darkness she decides she’s done with life. Trigger warning: suicide attempt. 😬 She’s pushed into The Midnight Library, where her school librarian greets her and explains the books of regret. Nora opens a book and lives a life had she done things differently. Book after book, life after life, she discovers who she could have been. ❤️ This book was beautifully magical and inspiring. I’d recommend this to anyone and everyone!! It is AMAZING!! ❤️📚3.75 stars. I love how unique this concept is, the conversation around mental health, and that it made me so introspective about my own life while reading it. I was so hooked when Nora went into the first few alternative lives but towards the end I started to get a little bored with lives 4+ (I felt like I already got the point in the first 3 lives). And I thought the ending was very predictable but I also can't imagine it ending any other way!So overall a little slow in the last third but love love love the concept and the messaging on regrets, life, and kindness.I ABSOLUTELY, TOTALLY, UNEQUIVOCALLY LOVED THIS BOOK!!!Who hasn't had regrets - wished they'd taken a different path in life, loved more and hated less, studied a little harder, applied themselves a bit more, had more faith in themselves, wished they'd liked themselves for who they were instead of what others wanted them to be?I'm certainly not immune, and I've actually fulfilled a couple of my life's ambitions, but life is not easy for any of us. As Nora was to discover, we all \"fear life\" to some degree - we learn pretty young that actions can have pretty painful consequences. Some of us stare that fear in the face and do what frightens us anyway. Many more of us, however, will step back and opt to take the safer road. I loved the notion of Nora being able to insert herself in a parallel timeline and see how her life would have been like had she taken a chance on all of those potentially life changing events. The whole parallel universe notion was so tantalizing! Imagine if you, too, could examine and then finally burn your own Book of Regrets and just move on with living your best life now?The first third of this novel is heavily mired in depression. If you've never felt stuck or depressed, you will certainly get a clue of what it feels like after you've read or listened to those first few chapters leading up to Nora's attempted suicide. There was a history of depression in Nora's mother's family. I was not surprised that Nora fell into depression after taking care of her mother during her long, protracted illness. Death has a way of stopping the clock for the survivors and making them examine the value of their own life. I suspect there will be many who will identify with most of what Nora thinks and says in this novel. Nora's Midnight Library is guarded and managed by her beloved childhood mentor and high school librarian, Mrs. Elm. There are several chapters devoted to Mrs. Elm's struggle to get Nora to try to experience one of the parallel lives in her Midnight library. This reflects the very real battle that a person with depression must face to get to the point where they can finally admit that they need help to get \"unstuck.\" Matt Haig has given a whole new meaning to the word \"potential.\" I totally agreed with Nora's final decision at the end of the book. In fact, I saw it coming even before she had completed her first journey. We can't live someone else's life. The choice must truly be our own if we want any abiding sense of fulfillment.This author - this book - has a lot to teach us. I am so very glad that I decided to check out what all the hype was about: turns out, all that hype was fully merited ! Loved every bit of it, including the sad parts. A full five out of five glowing stars for this heart-stirring, sanity-saving novel. We all need to burn our own book of regrets... and just get on with living our best life NOW! Highly, highly recommended!Note: I listened to the audiobook version, very ably narrated by the British film actress, Carey Mulligan. . . . . . . . . .You can check out this and other reviews on my partnered blog: https://crossingthepond.reviews/are the 10 most popular books of 2021 according to goodreads worth your time?\n  'if you aim to be something you are not, you will always fail. aim to be you... the truest version of you.'\nquietly profound and deeply meaningful.very 'the five people you meet in heaven' with a magical, bookish feel. perfect for anyone who had ever wondered if their life is enough.↠ "
